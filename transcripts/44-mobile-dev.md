One niche in programming that I personally have no experience with is building mobile applications. Well luckily today we have an expert to teach us all about it Timirah James, who is the founder of technigal LA and a developer evangelist will be teaching us all about it. Let's get started.

**Unknown Speaker**  0:23  
Welcome to the ladybug podcast. I'm Kelly. I'm Allie. And I'm Emma, and we're debugging the tech industry.

AWS amplify is a suite of tools and services that enables developers to build full stack serverless and cloud based web and mobile apps using their framework or technology of choice on the front end. Using amplify you can quickly get up and running with things like hosting authentication, managed graph qL serverless, functions API's, machine learning chat bots, and storage for files like images, videos and PDFs amplify is built especially in a way to enable traditionally front end developers like myself to be successful because they can use their existing skill set to build Real World full stack apps that in the past would require deep knowledge around back end DevOps and scalable infrastructure. The amplify console then allows you to use the GitHub repository to deploy a globally available CDN with ci NCD built in, learn more, visit AWS amplify github.io Are you a developer looking for your next challenge meets Shopify, they're on a mission to make commerce better for everyone. And they do things a bit differently. They don't tell you how to solve problems. They give you the tools, trust and autonomy to build new solutions. They don't want you to work alone. They're structured so you can leverage the diverse perspectives across teams and everything you do, and they don't pretend to have all the answers. They're big enough for you to tackle problems at scale, but small enough for you to discover and solve new problems. If you're a builder at heart who wants to solve highly technical problems, if you want to take all of your life experiences and apply them to a blank canvas, or if you want to access really powerful tools Shopify is the place for you.

Timirah, Welcome to the show super excited to have you and to learn all about mobile Dev. Because, as we were saying in the pre recording slot, Emma and I have no idea about mobile development and so this will be big for us and we can ask the beginner questions and they will be super genuine because we genuinely have no idea. Um, first off, do you want to tell us a little bit about yourself?

**Timirah James**  2:25  
Absolutely. Yes. So first of all, thanks for having me. Love, love, love the show and love all of you ladies. And I think we met in Amsterdam at a conference once we met in Amsterdam. A great time and Amsterdam. I think that was oh, I forget what conference that was. But it was

**Unknown Speaker**  2:47  
it was front end developer love uJs

**Timirah James**  2:49  
Vue JS? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. And yeah, so it the podcast has definitely grown from them. So um, thank you so much for having me. Yeah, so first and foremost, who am I to marry James, I am the founder of technical LA, as you mentioned, and basically technically was a meetup group that I started with my family here in LA just for women. It was typically actually for a younger age girls. So like in that high school age range, to kind of get them into STEM related things. And then next thing you know, we had like women who were like, in the midst of like career transitions coming through, we had like, stay at home moms coming through, and then we had college students coming through. So it was just like, you know, now it's like a, you know, women of all ages coming into, you know, just have employment opportunities, learning opportunities, networking opportunities, mentorship opportunities, you know, just in STEM and excelling in tech. So we do that here in LA hoping to expand, we actually just moved into our nonprofit status, which is a huge deal.

**Unknown Speaker**  4:09  
Yeah,

**Timirah James**  4:10  
thank you. Um, yeah, so I am just really ecstatic about that. And, you know, it kind of goes hand in hand with just me building communities and really being deeply embedded in the developer community, which rolls over into my other title, which is developer evangelist. So you know, everything from you know, speaking at conferences, giving technical talks at different tech events and developer based events. You know, which is now turned virtual, of course, but uh, you know, giving all kinds of workshops, connecting via meetups, just basically doing things to make developers lives a lot better and you know, using different just cool platforms and technologies to, you know, introduce to the developer community in order to like make their workflow a lot more convenient.

**Unknown Speaker**  5:09  
Yeah, so I definitely love what I do. That's good. Well, we're thankful for you too, because anything that makes our lives easier as a

**Timirah James**  5:17  
very Yes, yes.

**Unknown Speaker**  5:20  
I'm curious about your path to becoming a developer. Because I know like when I was in school, I didn't learn about mobile development at all, I didn't know as a career field. So could you tell us a bit more about how you got into evangelism and iOS development? Yeah,

**Timirah James**  5:35  
just my path to tech was definitely a non traditional pathway. Just first of all me coming from I didn't come from a tech based surrounding so there wasn't a lot of STEM you know, influences around me. But I was more based actually in the entertainment realm. So I was a little bit of a All Star I was like performing singing all over singing in Madison Square Garden. I was you know, my mom was my momager I mean, we had the whole night. My whole nine going, you know, so raised in New Jersey and then moved to Atlanta and it was in Atlanta where I kind of caught the stem bug. So I went to a performing arts high school, I ended up running around my junior year, I ran into a flyer that said, Hey, we're looking for high school age students to to basically be high school interns at these tech companies throughout the metro Atlanta area. And you know, and I saw all these different keywords with like, oh, web design, web development, isn't that and I'm like, What am I this is you know, and I say this every time I tell my story, I have to tell this part like this trait that I had, I'm so blessed to have that trait of curiosity, basically being at least five once you're 5% interested in something like just looking into it, at the very least, just look into it. And that is what pulled me towards there. And I was just like, wow, I think I need to try this. And they're like, $1,000 for the summer. And I was like, yeah, I'm definitely gonna try this. You know, that was a big deal, like 1617. So um, yeah, so I tried it. For I did it for two summers, I was a web designer. And then I turned into it turned into what web development and that was probably that was the most productive two summers that I've had. It was so eye opening to just see all the opportunities in STEM. And I was just so attracted to it. I was so excited about that. And I was like, You know what, this is The route I want to take in order, you know, to, you know, I had done so much in music and music was still my number one love and passion and, you know, that was in the right mind to just go forward with that as my primary career. But I always said I'd never wanted to go to college for music. I wanted to go to college for something else, I needed something as like a something that was going to be a solid skill for me outside of music. And I was just like computer science is it? So I basically I had a whole like, roadmap planned out for myself in my mind. I said, Okay, computer science, but what am I going to do with that? So I'm thinking great, you don't go to college for computer science graduate and what do I want to do? I think I want to go straight into mobile development. You know, this is after doing research and you know, really looking into Like what are the other outlets when it comes to stem? And I was just like, I want to I want to go into mobile development and the reason why is because you know, at that time I saw where the Technion phones, the technology and the phones were going at that time. I think we were so on flip phones. The cameras were new. We were like, Oh my goodness, you got the flip phone with the camera.

**Unknown Speaker**  9:26  
Selfie game strong.

**Timirah James**  9:27  
Yes. Oh my god, it's so fuzzy. So blurry. But we I mean, you can tell us that we would like you know, this is our that was our generation. We like oh my gosh, you got the camera. And yeah, and then you know, the iPhone, like the birth of the iPhone. You know, and the apps on the phone. And I saw that basically I had a vision. I was like, Oh my gosh, this is going to be something that is so powerful. Basically, we're not going to be able to Live Without our phone. So if I want to make the most impact and the heaviest, like impact as a developer, I think mobile is the way to go. So that's all I was really after was impact influence, you know, having that reach, you know, just being in people's pockets, you know. And, yeah, so that's really what pulled me towards mobile development. I was really, really attracted to it. So I had this whole plan in mind. I went to college, did about a year of that. Computer Science. And I ended up dropping out I ended up dropping out for several reasons. One being financial reasons and not on an academic side, but mostly, I went actually move to California to go to school. So from Atlanta to California, so There was a, there was, you know, there was issues with the room and board. There was issues also with just kind of the, the environment, shall I say the environment, there was no foundation for computer science students at my school, you know, and I will say like, if you're going to go to college for something as niche as computer science, you need to go to a to an institution that has a foundation for that kind of community like for that kind of profession because you know, that's really what you go to school for you go to school for the network, you go to school for the foundation, you go to school for the platform to be able to Excel to the next level, you know, you know, post graduation, so my school didn't have any of that they basically treat a computer science as an elective. And, yeah, there was no like, I had to beg for a tutor. I had to beg for like, any kind of just opportunity like that No, at the college put it like this at the career fair, like no one was looking for computer science like they didn't have any recruiters come specifically looking for programmers or anything like that. They were looking for people in marketing and x, y and z. So, again, my computer science department, they didn't even they really didn't care. Not to mention just again, the social structure, you know, no women and in the in the classroom, me being one of three women and the only woman in the a woman of color in the undergraduate program. So it was just a lot. Everything was kind of I felt like it was pushing me out and I took the leap. My mom was like my biggest cheerleader surprisingly. And I, you know, I probably am going on and on, but I promise you we're getting to the promised land. But, yeah, so basically I left school, and I decided I'm not going to after like a moment of being lost and trying to figure out where I'm going to go, what's going to happen next? How am I going to basically move forward? I decided that you know, what, I'm still me, I'm still going to push forward. You know, I'm so smart to Mira who's you know, who loves computers and I'm just gonna, I'm gonna I'm gonna run with it. I'm going to go with my dream of mobile development. And when I looked online, I was highly, highly upset. All of these free resources that I was like that I was missing. missing out on just because I didn't look into it. I just said, Okay, I got to go to college I got to go to Can I look online and basically the first thing I saw was Stanford's free cs 101. Course. And I was hated. Because I went to a private like, four year university, and I'm like, Ah, this is like a waste of money.

Like, oh my gosh, yeah, I was like, Oh my God.

And yeah, so I kind of just drowned myself in any kind of like mobile development resources courses. I didn't have any job or anything like that. I just kind of went for it. went for it. I um, I lived with my mom who had moved out, you know, and she didn't even she didn't know I was leaving school. She didn't you know, we didn't plan for that. But she moved out to California to kind of, you know, our world. Our family moved out there. So I was so grateful for that. So I was able to stay with my mom. And she, she just helped me through everything. And I really, really just studied at my craft. So I got into iOS development that kind of drew me in. And I just focused on that, you know, a lot of people talking about getting started in mobile development, choose a rap, choose a route, explore and choose a route you have to, you have to sharpen your skills in one area before you try to just, you know, go into everything at once. There's so many different resources and so many different technologies out there and it's good to like try them, but you want to make sure you become an expert in at least one you want to be strong and at least one of them in order to be valuable and have some valuable skills when it comes to like starting your career. So if focus in iOS development. Fast forward, me landing my first role in as an iOS engineer here in LA. And yeah, onward and forward from there. That was kind of like my journey. That's awesome.

**Unknown Speaker**  16:18  
That's so cool. It's really cool to meet someone who's so

**Unknown Speaker**  16:23  
versatile and their skill set. Like you mentioned, you did web development, and you did iOS development and design. And it's like, you can really, it was cool to see that you test it out a bunch of different things and then found the one that you're really passionate about. And I also think it's really great that you just told your story about how you actually left college because I think that'll resonate with many people. So thank you for sharing that. Absolutely.

**Timirah James**  16:49  
Yeah. And I was so nervous about that because I was just like when I first left, I didn't know that the the industry like the develop of media was like filled with mostly college dropouts. Basically, and I just felt like what am I gonna do? Like I have no, you know, school at school is structure? Definitely I have no structure I have no, you know, that's how I'm gonna get the jobs. How am I gonna? And when I really did the research again, I'm like, Oh my gosh, like the pillars of the industry are made up of college dropouts. Oh my goodness, no, like I can I can do this. Okay, I can I can do this I'm just not going to worry about trying to catch up with this or ketchup like I'm in my own space and not comparing myself that's another thing that I enjoy by studying myself. I wasn't comparing myself to anybody. I wasn't saying this student is farther along than I am. And I really had a chance to dive into what you know that just being an autodidact, basically it's very true that

**Unknown Speaker**  17:59  
I think I just tweeted about that today. And like if you went with the day that you stop comparing yourself to other people, and you start comparing yourself to yourself, is when you make the most progress. And my shout out at the end of this episode will be a book that actually helped me as realization stage of that Stay. Stay tuned to the end for that. But I'm curious, what is your day to day like? Like, what can a mobile dev expect?

**Timirah James**  18:25  
A mobile developer? Let's see. Well, it all depends on the company right? Now Me Myself, I work with mostly startups. And it was pretty much a similar process. So a typical day for me was coming into the office. And really, I guess about 1530 minutes within us like coming into the office, it would be a stand up. We would go over the things that we can accomplish the day before. Or throughout the throughout the week, building up into the day before. And some issues that we came across that we're we may be struggling with, we need help from other members on the team and just kind of throwing it out there and say, Hey, I'm struggling with this, X, Y, and Z. And then you know, people from you know, other members of the team will kind of open themselves up and say, Hey, I can help with that, or just kind of give their input on it. And also kind of declare your goals for the rest of that day or what you're trying to get done. So there'll be anywhere from depending upon how you how big your team is, and what the standard is, as far as how long your standup should be. It should be anywhere from like 30 the first 30 minutes to an hour. So you do your stand up and basically you knock out your Your goals for that day. It can be anything from, you know, feature add ons to bug fixes to, you know, working on an SDK to also again, helping out another team member on something that they may have been struggling with. So, you know, it could really, really vary. It's just like bass. It's not it's not too far off from, you know, a normal, you know, basically SW e roll you get you kind of knock out the tickets, and, you know, yeah, it's just the fun is in the process. The fun is in the code. We love coding, you love building you love learning, your day is going to be full of that you love just the feeling of really challenging yourself. mobile development No matter how much of an expert you are, I can be positive challenge So I saw it's constantly changing no matter which technology you could be iOS could be going to Android. It could be whatever. You know, it's the, the market is constantly changing. So yeah, you're always learning new things. And yeah, then seeing your awesome results in the users hands, of course, that's awesome.

**Ali**  21:23  
Okay, so again, we're total newbies to the world of mobiles out. So what technology is go into first mobile development in general? What does that whole ecosystem look like? But then also, specifically, what does an iOS dev work with?

**Timirah James**  21:39  
So let's say I'm not going to give a background just any kind of background starting with mobile development. There's so many different things you can be over really overwhelmed with the variety of different technologies and languages also that are You know, that support mobile development or get geared towards mobile development. One of the more popular ones, especially that web developers are running to, of course, that are more like on the cross platform side, meaning you maybe want to start with something that is not so Nish to one device or one OS. That would be something like React Native, right? So React Native. For those who don't know, React Native is a framework that was built by Facebook. And you can use JavaScript basically to build iOS applications as well as Android applications. So it's become really, really popular not only just because, you know, Facebook is kind of the big platform and the big you know, just entity that pushes it But just basically it's so easy to get started. And a lot of people have especially coming from that web development realm, something that's really, really comfortable. You can it's just really an additional framework when you when you look at it, and there's so many different frameworks, of course, when it comes to JavaScript, but yeah, and but React Native is just one of those things that is probably the most convenient when it comes to just getting started. And also, again, having that cross platform kind of flexibility, and not just be catering to like one device or a platform. So React Native is probably the top one and just getting started with that.

You would just need that JavaScript

experience, which I feel like JavaScript is such a powerful language and this is such a thing. Deep, deep, deep community that be a part of, you know, just developers who are more savvy when it comes to using JavaScript, the love hate relationship that developers have with it, but it is definitely one of the more flexible and just supported languages out there. So that's a good one. And then if you want to go more, Nish, you know or less. So before we go to Nish, there's another one that I do want to mention that I've actually played around with as well. So there's another framework that is really popular as well for cross platform development. And that is flutter. Okay. And flutter is a framework that was actually created by Google, that it's a little bit it's a little bit more different. Just because you're it's not something that you can use with it with a prior a prior language, right a language that you're, you're coming from another. You're familiar language, you have to learn a new language called Dart, which was created by Google. So a lot of people get confused. They're like, Oh, I'm building with flutter. And flutter is the framework that you're using and that you're building with. And Dart is the actual language that you're utilizing throughout that process. So yeah, so learning Dart. And Dart is a very simple, a fairly fairly simple language to learn. There's Google has done a great job of really spreading that awareness and building community around flutter. And really, just having a lot of have resources documentation video, just like there's so much just support and resources around flutter, and a continue to just build and expand on it. So flutter is another friendly language to try, excuse me a friendly framework to play around with if you have the time and the patience to play around with a new language, which is dark. That's really interesting. I didn't know that Dart was the language. And then flutter was the

**Unknown Speaker**  26:34  
framework because I heard about all these things. But when you're not in the realm of like mobile Dev, or back end Dev, for example, like you hear frameworks for back end, Dev, and I'm like, I didn't even know that was a framework.

**Unknown Speaker**  26:45  
You so that explanation was really spot on. Thank you.

**Timirah James**  26:49  
Yeah, and you know, some people that because it flutter I don't know why flutter is more kind of has more visibility than the actual language Dart So yeah, I don't know. So people don't know that Dart is, you know, you have to learn Dart. And but how they have you kind of get started is just the onboarding is really, really easy. They've done a great job with all the resources for onboarding new developers and new developers who are trying to learn. So it's really great. I'm just a fan of like, Great developer experiences. So yeah. So iOS development, when you're when you're getting started iOS development, of course, there's the there's the king Apple kind of situation, right? Where everyone knows that you have to use an apple, you know, an apple language to build on an apple platform, you know, using an apple built, you know, IBV and, you know, To build for Apple devices, you know, to build Apple products for Apple devices. So that's kind of the hierarchy there and where it gets really niche. Okay? And I won't say tricky because, first, for a lot of reasons, it can be a lot more convenient because it's more it's more focused, it's more narrow, you kind of know, where all the things are there, there are a lot less a lot less variability in platforms that you can use, right? So you know, there's a straight line when it comes to this path of iOS development. So um, yeah, so let's say you just want to get started right now. The primary language for iOS development is Swift. So you ladies like familiar with swift or, like, how do you feel about swift? I tried to read

**Unknown Speaker**  28:54  
a book on it once and I got like four pages in and I'm like, I'm not

**Timirah James**  29:01  
Oh my gosh. That is like you

**Unknown Speaker**  29:04  
like reading books about this is probably not the best way to get excited about it. Like I should have watched a course. But at the time I didn't know about online. I don't know why. Oh

**Timirah James**  29:13  
my gosh, yes, yes. And I wish you would have come to me. Yes. We need to.

**Unknown Speaker**  29:18  
We This was back when I was. I was back in college at the time. And I think it was probably a sophomore in college. And I was like, oh, mobile dev looks cool. And then I didn't know that there's a whole online ecosystem for learning.

**Ali**  29:30  
Oh, my gosh, I mentored a middle school hackathon. And they were all using swift but that's my only experience with Swift is mentoring that like

**Timirah James**  29:43  
oh, wow, school. You know what? And to hear you say, like, Oh my gosh, like Swift is not so exciting. I like beginner friendly. No like it cuz here's the thing I always I always base my grounds on like, Promoting swift online. It's so, so simple to get started. So, so easy. So, so clean, so precise, you know, kind of like my whole spiel on swift and granite like, you know, swift came out. slipped is about, I don't know, six years old is still not that old. So like, that was another thing when it first came out. Because you know, Objective C was the primary language for like, over three decades for iOS development. And then swift just came out like six years ago. And so people were a little bit skeptical. It was something that was super new. And of course, there wasn't a lot of resources around it to get started. It was just new. But people who were in the iOS community, they were a little more like that. Okay, this is simple. This is something, um, you know, and yeah, so it's a little bit it's tricky because like, it's still kind of a new net language, but it has grown so much in terms of like, resources and like getting started and like it's so I promise you is so much easier to get started. Now with swift and like swift has grown actually, in so many different ways. You don't even have to build for iOS development with swift primarily anymore, like swift has grown in so many ways. Like, you can use swift on the server. Now I'm sure you've seen some things about server side Swift. You might have seen some things and like, big companies are adopting it. You know, there's AWS and, you know, just there's so so many different platforms like really starting to add on some, you know, support for Swift. So, yeah, you can use swift on the back end. You can you know, Swift is also an open source language now, so That opened up a whole a whole kind of thing where now the community is able to contribute and like build this language together. So that was a huge huge deal. But yeah, so like just getting started with iOS development primary language you want to learn swift you want to uh you know, of course Xcode is the primary ID. Now again, swift has grown in support. So now you can use it with you can use it with sublime you can use with all these different like, all these different IDs now. So it's not just limited to Xcode, which is different for people in the iOS community. We're all we always used to like, oh, building for iOS, you have to use Xcode. So yeah, it's a bit refreshing, but I would recommend to Starting with Xcode, because you have all the native components when it comes to building for an iOS experience, a true native iOS experience. So definitely using Xcode to build. Also being a part of Apple's developer program, okay, which is about I believe it's $100 a year $99 a year to be a part of and just, you know, have that membership. What that does is that gives you a developer profile to publish to be, you know, to publish your app into the App Store. And so yeah, so you you kind of have that $99 a year membership, and that allows you to properly test out via Expo test out your Applications and also publish the via the in the App Store. So you want to do that. And Bill just building out you want to learn as much as possible. There's a YouTube, there's, I'm gonna shout out myself. I've done a lot of like iOS content, you know, and even just my old content as well.

And you know, I'm available on Twitter as well. You can always ask me any kind of like iOS questions, or just mobile questions. But just getting started. There's like Apple does a great job of documentation as well and providing a platform for onboarding and it's such a huge, huge community to be a part of. There's so many different resources just to get started and build something super simple and super cool. Especially using swift and it's really in Swift is also really good. Like if you're coming from a JavaScript background, it's there's a lot of familiarity in the syntax. So that that's probably the best the best thing and it's grown so much. Like I said, since like six years ago, when it first came out, it's gotten a lot simpler, a lot more performative. Just a lot, just faster, and the syntax has gotten a lot smoother. And, you know, Swift is really a language that is really built on just legibility, and just being concise and precise. And, yeah, so that, you know, that's, that's kind of a jumpstart kit for getting into iOS development. That's awesome.

**Ali**  35:49  
I think you touched on this, but how do you actually get your app accepted and published onto the app store?

**Timirah James**  35:57  
Oh, that is a great question. That's a great question, because Sometimes like you if you scared to get your your your your foot through the door, and you're just like, trying to get past you know, you're past the hello world, but you're you're really just in Project land and you you don't want to limit yourself in terms of not actually publishing something that's what really pushed me through the door and getting my my first iOS engineering role. Being a college dropout, I did not have the opportunity to have an internship or be eligible for an internship. I didn't have any prior experience, I really had to go on whatever I had done on GitHub, and I said, What can I do to stand out and I wanted to publish something into the app store and that was kind of the kind of beat me up just being, you know, having something that was published. And users were actually Using So, alright, so step one, before anything where you get too happy and you're like yes, yes, yes, I want to publish the things I want to do all the things. Well, I would definitely strongly encourage you to make sure that your app complies with the apple design guidelines. Okay, so you want to review the apple design guidelines, you can Google it and go on Apple's website and you can look up the apple design guidelines. And really, they want to know, you know, they're going to do a review process, which I've heard my first application. I got super, super blessed because it was, you know, I think it took like five days at the time. I think the average time took about eight days, but I've heard horror stories of three weeks a month and I've heard like horror stories of Not only just the waiting time but also having the app go through several different rounds of review, just because, again, there was something was super buggy. It didn't just, it just didn't comply with the design guidelines. So I made sure I did my research. Okay. So, before you submit, you want to make sure that you test your app for crashes, and bugs, right? You want to ensure that you know all the app information and metadata is complete and accurate. You want to make sure that you know you enable on like your back end using a third party, you enable, you know your backup services. So it just basically make sure it's in its full form. Okay, so that the reviewers can properly kind of go through the process, whatever the user is going to do. They need to be able to like go through the whole flow. Okay. Again, complying with those design guidelines and making sure that you're using assets that are legal to use also, they look that up as well.

I, myself I used to use.

And you can always create your own right, you can use like sketch or figma, or whatever platforms you use to like create your own assets in a mobile app, but you can like, there's different websites that you can use that you can have, they allow you to add them into your application that are free. They're royalty free, that are free for creative use. And yeah, you want to make sure all of that is kind of like, cool, and they want to make sure there's no like, I mean, I don't want to say plagiarism, but more so like, you're not stealing assets, basically. Yeah, so basically, keeping up with those design guidelines, making sure it's nice and bug free, for the most part. The average time, like I said, you submit it. And average time for review is like, five to seven days. And voila, your app should be live and running and in users hands in no time. That's awesome.

**Unknown Speaker**  40:20  
That's really great. That's very useful to you. Because I would never have thought to go look at the design guidelines before just like I would totally just blind submit it and have no idea but i'm, i'm curious just to kind of like wrap things up. If someone listening is interested in getting into mobile Dev, or they're about to have their first interview. What can they expect out of a mobile development? technical interview? Oh,

**Timirah James**  40:42  
yes. So let me speak to it, especially like the iOS interview process. And this is different. So for example, I've interviewed with Apple before. So this is like, I would say, fairly recent. So I believe is still quite an actually it is more in quite the same. I spoken with a few peers of mine and the interview process is pretty much kind of the same flow. It's one of the better interview processes also. Basically, after applying, you have an initial call, just kind of seeing where your interests are, where you're, you know, where your skills lie, and then it's elevated to elevate it to someone else. Someone who is a little more technical and it's still not a technical like, like debriefing where they're just like really, really going going in on you. It's again, just to see where your skill set is. They're not giving you any like trick questions or anything. They're just really trying to see where you are and then they say, Okay, well, we're going to send you a coding project. And they give you a timeline. They say don't spend more than however many hours on it usually maximum four and say, Hey, don't spend any more than four hours, it really shouldn't, you know, expect you to spend more than that, but eat but they still give you. They don't do like the time tests or any like specialized tests like that is really more so like the coding project is like build an app that uses this framework, this framework that does this. And this is like a real world type app. So let's say, okay, build an app that uses the iTunes API. And, you know, it has images, you know, so we want the images to be, you know, cached, we want this we want that we want to be able to categorize the the cash To log in the iTunes API. And, yeah, so you basically go through all of this, you build the application, they give you a couple of days to submit, you submitted, they do a review. And the they have someone from a callback. And the callback again is not to grill you is just to go through whatever the process is what you know, what what did you do to accomplish this? and any other questions that they have about your code the project in general challenges you've had x y&z so then it kind of move forward from there. I think there's a panel interview as well. And then you know, hopefully, hopefully, a positive decision is reached after that. And offer you know, so that's more song like just For apple in itself, I do feel like that's more of the it's probably the better side of the iOS interview process, but it differs so much. interviewing for startups can vary like it varies from company to company. So like for startups, you typically get someone you know you go through the phone call or whatever and then you do you get on the phone with someone and you have some form of a technical screen where they're throwing questions at you that have to do with the swift language. So the question you on syntactic questioning you on frameworks they give you scenarios. The question the question you on terminology, you know, what is an optional describe to me what happens in threading, you know, multi threading described to me that process described to me, you know, X, Y, and Z And you kind of just go on from there just they're kind of quizzing you. And then from there on, it can be some form of a coding.

Like, you know, it can be

more of an on screen technical. Uh, yeah, like an on like a an on screen like technical screen. So basically you having whatever their browser based IP is, um, and kind of coding like pair programming or they watch you kind of solve a problem using Swift. So yeah, it can vary from there. And if you're going for other than, you know, besides Apple be going for a top tier companies such as, and this is where it kind of deviates, you going from a top tier, you go into a top tier companies such as like Facebook, I've had so I've had a trick interview process with Facebook, actually. So I had it, we had the initial call, and I thought the initial call was just going to be, you know, just like every additional call, we're just going over like skills and, you know, compatibility in terms of like the roll and things of that nature experience. But then at the end, they just threw in the technical questions. I was like, Oh, okay. So like, so the recruiter, threw in the technical questions, and they were mostly like, iOS swift based, um, it threw me off guard, but I passed. And then they're like, Okay, so, Next up, we're going to do, we're going to do a coding project. And then after the coding project we're going to do we're going to have the review, right? We're gonna have it you know, again, the the engineer kind of review that But also we're going to after that, we're going to kind of test you on data structures and algorithms, like, I'm kind of getting into more of the CS theory bag. So I'm like, Okay, I'm like, okay, so I have to, like, study way off, you know, I always get thrown way off whenever I have to go into that bag, because it's so long, like, think about the time span, right? You're working on something, you know, you're building, you're using these different technologies. You're doing great in this in this specified tech stack around, right. And then you know, you're doing that for I don't know, anywhere from six months to like two years at this one company. And then you say, hey, I want to move on to another company. And, you know, you have to prepare something totally different. outside of your skill set for the interview process, but they still, you know, in the role, they don't want you to use any of those skills that you just study for they want to you, they want you to, they're hiring you for the skills that you've had from your prior role. So, you know, having to go back into that college bag is always just a drag. Because there's always so long in between those times where I have to study and it's just for such a momentary situation, you

**Ali**  48:30  
know, for sure interviews are such a messy process across tech, I think. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Thank you so so much again for joining us on the show today and teaching us all about mobile development. Where can we find you on the internet?

**Timirah James**  48:49  
I you can find me all throughout the internet's the internet.

**Unknown Speaker**  48:57  
But

**Timirah James**  48:58  
yeah, mostly actually. on twitter at to marriage a ti m IRHJ. You can tweet me You can follow me. You can DM me, my DMS are always open, ask me questions, collaborate on things, so on and so forth. So yeah, follow me on Twitter. Also the same Tamara Jay on Instagram, and connect with me on LinkedIn to Mary James. And okay, yeah, I'll just put that on my website out there to Tamara James calm.

**Unknown Speaker**  49:32  
Yeah. And well, we're gonna be linking all of these in the show notes. If you want to go check out Tamara. And the best part is, she is available for hire. So if you are interested in hiring to Mira if you want her for a job, evangelist role, where's the best place people can contact you for that?

**Timirah James**  49:48  
Yeah, absolutely. Um, I believe Twitter is still the probably the best forum to get me is very immediate and very like, you don't just my dm are always open. So if you want to reach me, you can definitely get me on Twitter. And you can connect with me also on LinkedIn to marriage, James on LinkedIn, and I am looking for more of the dev REL role. So anything again to make other developers lives easier. That's like, that's my passion. That's right up my alley and building communities, and just bettering the developer ecosystem. That's really where my heart is wonderful. Thank you so much. It was like such a pleasure especially because I knew nothing about mobile Dev and it's always fun to talk to you. I'm, you know, when you get to talk as much as I wanted to and am so I'm really excited that you are willing to come on and teach us about Absolutely, I feel like as you can see, I can go on and on. You know,

**Unknown Speaker**  50:46  
I really love it. It's good. It means you're passionate.

**Unknown Speaker**  50:50  
So we like to wrap things up here by doing a shout out to either someone or something that we are thankful for or we think is really cool. We want to share with the listener. So what Or who would you like to shout out,

**Timirah James**  51:01  
I would like to shout out everyone who has contributed to the Black Lives Matter movement. I would like to shout out everyone who has and I mean that in every way whether you've protested whether you've contributed whether you've done something to amplify black voices, whether you reached out to a co worker, just check on them, you know, whether you have just raised you know, just elevated your, your your own voice and paints throughout the Black Lives Matter movement that's going on right now. It's totally appreciate it. I want to shout out people who are struggling right now, through everything that has been so traumatic for all of us, this troubling time people who are dealing with mental health issues. We're dealing with that before all of this was going on, and who are just fighting through that, and trying to just keep keep their heads above water. And people again, who are also fighting to, you know, for jobs who have lost jobs in this time and in this climate in this weird time that we're in, and who are also going through these interview processes. I really hope that what I said anything of what I said, helped you with any kind of clarity. I want to be a resource to you. Like I said, you can reach me on twitter at Tamara Jay, you can connect with me on LinkedIn as well. But I want to let all those people know that you are seeing you are heard you are appreciated. You are loved at this time. And, you know, I just want to acknowledge you right now. Oh, that's really that was

**Unknown Speaker**  52:59  
words. Thank you. You for that?

**Ali**  53:01  
Yeah, it was amazing. Yeah.

**Unknown Speaker**  53:03  
How about you ally? What would you like to shout out?

**Ali**  53:06  
I don't know how to follow that one

**Unknown Speaker**  53:07  
up.

**Ali**  53:11  
Yeah. Um, so a project that I think is really, really cool right now is the web monetization API. So there is this project to fund content creators through a subscription type model. And every time that somebody who is subscribed to this service visits your site, you make income off of that without advertising without any kind of sketchy things. And I think that it could lead to a more ethical web. So it's a movement that I'm really excited about dev to just integrated into their platform and so excited to see where it goes. Emma, how about your so

**Unknown Speaker**  53:55  
I'm reading this book called the courage to be disliked, and it's the Japanese phenomenon. Went on that shows you how to change your life and achieve real happiness. And it's very interesting because it, it feels like a nonfiction book. But I think it's based on like Greek and German philosophy. And it's a conversation between a philosopher and a student. And I've learned a lot like one of the things we've mentioned earlier was focused on yourself, compare yourself to who you were yesterday and not other people around you. And there are a lot of really great sentiments coming out of that. So if you are looking for a book to kind of change your mindset, whether that's, you know, I think in our education episode, we talked about fixed versus growth mindset. It touches on some of those principles as well. Highly recommend it. So, you know, just I just want to give one more thank you to Tamir for joining us today. And if you like this episode, just tweet about it. You know, we'd love reading your feedback. Also, feel free to connect with Tamir on Twitter and LinkedIn, we have those linked down below. And we post new podcasts every Monday so just make sure to be subscribed to be notified and leave us a review. Have a nice, fun day.

One niche in programming that I personally have no experience with is building mobile applications. Well luckily today we have an expert to teach us all about it to marry James, who is the founder of technic gal LA and a developer evangelist will be teaching us all about it. Let's get started.

**Unknown Speaker**  0:23  
Welcome to the ladybug podcast. I'm Kelly. I'm Allie. And I'm Emma, and we're debugging the tech industry.

**Unknown Speaker**  0:31  
AWS amplify is a suite of tools and services that enables developers to build full stack serverless and cloud based web and mobile apps using their framework or technology of choice on the front end. Using amplify you can quickly get up and running with things like hosting authentication, managed graph qL serverless, functions API's, machine learning chat bots, and storage for files like images, videos and PDFs amplify is built especially in a way to enable traditionally front end developers like myself to be successful because they can use their existing skill set to build Real World full stack apps that in the past would require deep knowledge around back end DevOps and scalable infrastructure. The amplify console then allows you to use the GitHub repository to deploy a globally available CDN with ci NCD built in, learn more, visit AWS amplify github.io Are you a developer looking for your next challenge meets Shopify, they're on a mission to make commerce better for everyone. And they do things a bit differently. They don't tell you how to solve problems. They give you the tools, trust and autonomy to build new solutions. They don't want you to work alone. They're structured so you can leverage the diverse perspectives across teams and everything you do, and they don't pretend to have all the answers. They're big enough for you to tackle problems at scale, but small enough for you to discover and solve new problems. If you're a builder at heart who wants to solve highly technical problems, if you want to take all of your life experiences and apply them to a blank canvas, or if you want to access really powerful tools Shopify is the place for you.

Tamir Welcome to the show super excited to have you and to learn all about mobile Dev. Because, as we were saying in the pre recording slot, Emma and I have no idea about mobile development and so this will be big for us and we can ask the beginner questions and they will be super genuine because we genuinely have no idea. Um, first off, do you want to tell us a little bit about yourself?

**Timirah James**  2:25  
Absolutely. Yes. So first of all, thanks for having me. Love, love, love the show and love all of you ladies. And I think we met in Amsterdam at a conference once we met in Amsterdam. A great time and Amsterdam. I think that was oh, I forget what conference that was. But it was

**Unknown Speaker**  2:47  
it was front end developer love uJs

**Timirah James**  2:49  
Vue JS? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. And yeah, so it the podcast has definitely grown from them. So um, thank you so much for having me. Yeah, so first and foremost, who am I to marry James, I am the founder of technical LA, as you mentioned, and basically technically was a meetup group that I started with my family here in LA just for women. It was typically actually for a younger age girls. So like in that high school age range, to kind of get them into STEM related things. And then next thing you know, we had like women who were like, in the midst of like career transitions coming through, we had like, stay at home moms coming through, and then we had college students coming through. So it was just like, you know, now it's like a, you know, women of all ages coming into, you know, just have employment opportunities, learning opportunities, networking opportunities, mentorship opportunities, you know, just in STEM and excelling in tech. So we do that here in LA hoping to expand, we actually just moved into our nonprofit status, which is a huge deal.

**Unknown Speaker**  4:09  
Yeah,

**Timirah James**  4:10  
thank you. Um, yeah, so I am just really ecstatic about that. And, you know, it kind of goes hand in hand with just me building communities and really being deeply embedded in the developer community, which rolls over into my other title, which is developer evangelist. So you know, everything from you know, speaking at conferences, giving technical talks at different tech events and developer based events. You know, which is now turned virtual, of course, but uh, you know, giving all kinds of workshops, connecting via meetups, just basically doing things to make developers lives a lot better and you know, using different just cool platforms and technologies to, you know, introduce to the developer community in order to like make their workflow a lot more convenient.

**Unknown Speaker**  5:09  
Yeah, so I definitely love what I do. That's good. Well, we're thankful for you too, because anything that makes our lives easier as a

**Timirah James**  5:17  
very Yes, yes.

**Unknown Speaker**  5:20  
I'm curious about your path to becoming a developer. Because I know like when I was in school, I didn't learn about mobile development at all, I didn't know as a career field. So could you tell us a bit more about how you got into evangelism and iOS development? Yeah,

**Timirah James**  5:35  
just my path to tech was definitely a non traditional pathway. Just first of all me coming from I didn't come from a tech based surrounding so there wasn't a lot of STEM you know, influences around me. But I was more based actually in the entertainment realm. So I was a little bit of a All Star I was like performing singing all over singing in Madison Square Garden. I was you know, my mom was my momager I mean, we had the whole night. My whole nine going, you know, so raised in New Jersey and then moved to Atlanta and it was in Atlanta where I kind of caught the stem bug. So I went to a performing arts high school, I ended up running around my junior year, I ran into a flyer that said, Hey, we're looking for high school age students to to basically be high school interns at these tech companies throughout the metro Atlanta area. And you know, and I saw all these different keywords with like, oh, web design, web development, isn't that and I'm like, What am I this is you know, and I say this every time I tell my story, I have to tell this part like this trait that I had, I'm so blessed to have that trait of curiosity, basically being at least five once you're 5% interested in something like just looking into it, at the very least, just look into it. And that is what pulled me towards there. And I was just like, wow, I think I need to try this. And they're like, $1,000 for the summer. And I was like, yeah, I'm definitely gonna try this. You know, that was a big deal, like 1617. So um, yeah, so I tried it. For I did it for two summers, I was a web designer. And then I turned into it turned into what web development and that was probably that was the most productive two summers that I've had. It was so eye opening to just see all the opportunities in STEM. And I was just so attracted to it. I was so excited about that. And I was like, You know what, this is The route I want to take in order, you know, to, you know, I had done so much in music and music was still my number one love and passion and, you know, that was in the right mind to just go forward with that as my primary career. But I always said I'd never wanted to go to college for music. I wanted to go to college for something else, I needed something as like a something that was going to be a solid skill for me outside of music. And I was just like computer science is it? So I basically I had a whole like, roadmap planned out for myself in my mind. I said, Okay, computer science, but what am I going to do with that? So I'm thinking great, you don't go to college for computer science graduate and what do I want to do? I think I want to go straight into mobile development. You know, this is after doing research and you know, really looking into Like what are the other outlets when it comes to stem? And I was just like, I want to I want to go into mobile development and the reason why is because you know, at that time I saw where the Technion phones, the technology and the phones were going at that time. I think we were so on flip phones. The cameras were new. We were like, Oh my goodness, you got the flip phone with the camera.

**Unknown Speaker**  9:26  
Selfie game strong.

**Timirah James**  9:27  
Yes. Oh my god, it's so fuzzy. So blurry. But we I mean, you can tell us that we would like you know, this is our that was our generation. We like oh my gosh, you got the camera. And yeah, and then you know, the iPhone, like the birth of the iPhone. You know, and the apps on the phone. And I saw that basically I had a vision. I was like, Oh my gosh, this is going to be something that is so powerful. Basically, we're not going to be able to Live Without our phone. So if I want to make the most impact and the heaviest, like impact as a developer, I think mobile is the way to go. So that's all I was really after was impact influence, you know, having that reach, you know, just being in people's pockets, you know. And, yeah, so that's really what pulled me towards mobile development. I was really, really attracted to it. So I had this whole plan in mind. I went to college, did about a year of that. Computer Science. And I ended up dropping out I ended up dropping out for several reasons. One being financial reasons and not on an academic side, but mostly, I went actually move to California to go to school. So from Atlanta to California, so There was a, there was, you know, there was issues with the room and board. There was issues also with just kind of the, the environment, shall I say the environment, there was no foundation for computer science students at my school, you know, and I will say like, if you're going to go to college for something as niche as computer science, you need to go to a to an institution that has a foundation for that kind of community like for that kind of profession because you know, that's really what you go to school for you go to school for the network, you go to school for the foundation, you go to school for the platform to be able to Excel to the next level, you know, you know, post graduation, so my school didn't have any of that they basically treat a computer science as an elective. And, yeah, there was no like, I had to beg for a tutor. I had to beg for like, any kind of just opportunity like that No, at the college put it like this at the career fair, like no one was looking for computer science like they didn't have any recruiters come specifically looking for programmers or anything like that. They were looking for people in marketing and x, y and z. So, again, my computer science department, they didn't even they really didn't care. Not to mention just again, the social structure, you know, no women and in the in the classroom, me being one of three women and the only woman in the a woman of color in the undergraduate program. So it was just a lot. Everything was kind of I felt like it was pushing me out and I took the leap. My mom was like my biggest cheerleader surprisingly. And I, you know, I probably am going on and on, but I promise you we're getting to the promised land. But, yeah, so basically I left school, and I decided I'm not going to after like a moment of being lost and trying to figure out where I'm going to go, what's going to happen next? How am I going to basically move forward? I decided that you know, what, I'm still me, I'm still going to push forward. You know, I'm so smart to Mira who's you know, who loves computers and I'm just gonna, I'm gonna I'm gonna run with it. I'm going to go with my dream of mobile development. And when I looked online, I was highly, highly upset. All of these free resources that I was like that I was missing. missing out on just because I didn't look into it. I just said, Okay, I got to go to college I got to go to Can I look online and basically the first thing I saw was Stanford's free cs 101. Course. And I was hated. Because I went to a private like, four year university, and I'm like, Ah, this is like a waste of money.

Like, oh my gosh, yeah, I was like, Oh my God.

And yeah, so I kind of just drowned myself in any kind of like mobile development resources courses. I didn't have any job or anything like that. I just kind of went for it. went for it. I um, I lived with my mom who had moved out, you know, and she didn't even she didn't know I was leaving school. She didn't you know, we didn't plan for that. But she moved out to California to kind of, you know, our world. Our family moved out there. So I was so grateful for that. So I was able to stay with my mom. And she, she just helped me through everything. And I really, really just studied at my craft. So I got into iOS development that kind of drew me in. And I just focused on that, you know, a lot of people talking about getting started in mobile development, choose a rap, choose a route, explore and choose a route you have to, you have to sharpen your skills in one area before you try to just, you know, go into everything at once. There's so many different resources and so many different technologies out there and it's good to like try them, but you want to make sure you become an expert in at least one you want to be strong and at least one of them in order to be valuable and have some valuable skills when it comes to like starting your career. So if focus in iOS development. Fast forward, me landing my first role in as an iOS engineer here in LA. And yeah, onward and forward from there. That was kind of like my journey. That's awesome.

**Unknown Speaker**  16:18  
That's so cool. It's really cool to meet someone who's so

**Unknown Speaker**  16:23  
versatile and their skill set. Like you mentioned, you did web development, and you did iOS development and design. And it's like, you can really, it was cool to see that you test it out a bunch of different things and then found the one that you're really passionate about. And I also think it's really great that you just told your story about how you actually left college because I think that'll resonate with many people. So thank you for sharing that. Absolutely.

**Timirah James**  16:49  
Yeah. And I was so nervous about that because I was just like when I first left, I didn't know that the the industry like the develop of media was like filled with mostly college dropouts. Basically, and I just felt like what am I gonna do? Like I have no, you know, school at school is structure? Definitely I have no structure I have no, you know, that's how I'm gonna get the jobs. How am I gonna? And when I really did the research again, I'm like, Oh my gosh, like the pillars of the industry are made up of college dropouts. Oh my goodness, no, like I can I can do this. Okay, I can I can do this I'm just not going to worry about trying to catch up with this or ketchup like I'm in my own space and not comparing myself that's another thing that I enjoy by studying myself. I wasn't comparing myself to anybody. I wasn't saying this student is farther along than I am. And I really had a chance to dive into what you know that just being an autodidact, basically it's very true that

**Unknown Speaker**  17:59  
I think I just tweeted about that today. And like if you went with the day that you stop comparing yourself to other people, and you start comparing yourself to yourself, is when you make the most progress. And my shout out at the end of this episode will be a book that actually helped me as realization stage of that Stay. Stay tuned to the end for that. But I'm curious, what is your day to day like? Like, what can a mobile dev expect?

**Timirah James**  18:25  
A mobile developer? Let's see. Well, it all depends on the company right? Now Me Myself, I work with mostly startups. And it was pretty much a similar process. So a typical day for me was coming into the office. And really, I guess about 1530 minutes within us like coming into the office, it would be a stand up. We would go over the things that we can accomplish the day before. Or throughout the throughout the week, building up into the day before. And some issues that we came across that we're we may be struggling with, we need help from other members on the team and just kind of throwing it out there and say, Hey, I'm struggling with this, X, Y, and Z. And then you know, people from you know, other members of the team will kind of open themselves up and say, Hey, I can help with that, or just kind of give their input on it. And also kind of declare your goals for the rest of that day or what you're trying to get done. So there'll be anywhere from depending upon how you how big your team is, and what the standard is, as far as how long your standup should be. It should be anywhere from like 30 the first 30 minutes to an hour. So you do your stand up and basically you knock out your Your goals for that day. It can be anything from, you know, feature add ons to bug fixes to, you know, working on an SDK to also again, helping out another team member on something that they may have been struggling with. So, you know, it could really, really vary. It's just like bass. It's not it's not too far off from, you know, a normal, you know, basically SW e roll you get you kind of knock out the tickets, and, you know, yeah, it's just the fun is in the process. The fun is in the code. We love coding, you love building you love learning, your day is going to be full of that you love just the feeling of really challenging yourself. mobile development No matter how much of an expert you are, I can be positive challenge So I saw it's constantly changing no matter which technology you could be iOS could be going to Android. It could be whatever. You know, it's the, the market is constantly changing. So yeah, you're always learning new things. And yeah, then seeing your awesome results in the users hands, of course, that's awesome.

**Ali**  21:23  
Okay, so again, we're total newbies to the world of mobiles out. So what technology is go into first mobile development in general? What does that whole ecosystem look like? But then also, specifically, what does an iOS dev work with?

**Timirah James**  21:39  
So let's say I'm not going to give a background just any kind of background starting with mobile development. There's so many different things you can be over really overwhelmed with the variety of different technologies and languages also that are You know, that support mobile development or get geared towards mobile development. One of the more popular ones, especially that web developers are running to, of course, that are more like on the cross platform side, meaning you maybe want to start with something that is not so Nish to one device or one OS. That would be something like React Native, right? So React Native. For those who don't know, React Native is a framework that was built by Facebook. And you can use JavaScript basically to build iOS applications as well as Android applications. So it's become really, really popular not only just because, you know, Facebook is kind of the big platform and the big you know, just entity that pushes it But just basically it's so easy to get started. And a lot of people have especially coming from that web development realm, something that's really, really comfortable. You can it's just really an additional framework when you when you look at it, and there's so many different frameworks, of course, when it comes to JavaScript, but yeah, and but React Native is just one of those things that is probably the most convenient when it comes to just getting started. And also, again, having that cross platform kind of flexibility, and not just be catering to like one device or a platform. So React Native is probably the top one and just getting started with that.

You would just need that JavaScript

experience, which I feel like JavaScript is such a powerful language and this is such a thing. Deep, deep, deep community that be a part of, you know, just developers who are more savvy when it comes to using JavaScript, the love hate relationship that developers have with it, but it is definitely one of the more flexible and just supported languages out there. So that's a good one. And then if you want to go more, Nish, you know or less. So before we go to Nish, there's another one that I do want to mention that I've actually played around with as well. So there's another framework that is really popular as well for cross platform development. And that is flutter. Okay. And flutter is a framework that was actually created by Google, that it's a little bit it's a little bit more different. Just because you're it's not something that you can use with it with a prior a prior language, right a language that you're, you're coming from another. You're familiar language, you have to learn a new language called Dart, which was created by Google. So a lot of people get confused. They're like, Oh, I'm building with flutter. And flutter is the framework that you're using and that you're building with. And Dart is the actual language that you're utilizing throughout that process. So yeah, so learning Dart. And Dart is a very simple, a fairly fairly simple language to learn. There's Google has done a great job of really spreading that awareness and building community around flutter. And really, just having a lot of have resources documentation video, just like there's so much just support and resources around flutter, and a continue to just build and expand on it. So flutter is another friendly language to try, excuse me a friendly framework to play around with if you have the time and the patience to play around with a new language, which is dark. That's really interesting. I didn't know that Dart was the language. And then flutter was the

**Unknown Speaker**  26:34  
framework because I heard about all these things. But when you're not in the realm of like mobile Dev, or back end Dev, for example, like you hear frameworks for back end, Dev, and I'm like, I didn't even know that was a framework.

**Unknown Speaker**  26:45  
You so that explanation was really spot on. Thank you.

**Timirah James**  26:49  
Yeah, and you know, some people that because it flutter I don't know why flutter is more kind of has more visibility than the actual language Dart So yeah, I don't know. So people don't know that Dart is, you know, you have to learn Dart. And but how they have you kind of get started is just the onboarding is really, really easy. They've done a great job with all the resources for onboarding new developers and new developers who are trying to learn. So it's really great. I'm just a fan of like, Great developer experiences. So yeah. So iOS development, when you're when you're getting started iOS development, of course, there's the there's the king Apple kind of situation, right? Where everyone knows that you have to use an apple, you know, an apple language to build on an apple platform, you know, using an apple built, you know, IBV and, you know, To build for Apple devices, you know, to build Apple products for Apple devices. So that's kind of the hierarchy there and where it gets really niche. Okay? And I won't say tricky because, first, for a lot of reasons, it can be a lot more convenient because it's more it's more focused, it's more narrow, you kind of know, where all the things are there, there are a lot less a lot less variability in platforms that you can use, right? So you know, there's a straight line when it comes to this path of iOS development. So um, yeah, so let's say you just want to get started right now. The primary language for iOS development is Swift. So you ladies like familiar with swift or, like, how do you feel about swift? I tried to read

**Unknown Speaker**  28:54  
a book on it once and I got like four pages in and I'm like, I'm not

**Timirah James**  29:01  
Oh my gosh. That is like you

**Unknown Speaker**  29:04  
like reading books about this is probably not the best way to get excited about it. Like I should have watched a course. But at the time I didn't know about online. I don't know why. Oh

**Timirah James**  29:13  
my gosh, yes, yes. And I wish you would have come to me. Yes. We need to.

**Unknown Speaker**  29:18  
We This was back when I was. I was back in college at the time. And I think it was probably a sophomore in college. And I was like, oh, mobile dev looks cool. And then I didn't know that there's a whole online ecosystem for learning.

**Ali**  29:30  
Oh, my gosh, I mentored a middle school hackathon. And they were all using swift but that's my only experience with Swift is mentoring that like

**Timirah James**  29:43  
oh, wow, school. You know what? And to hear you say, like, Oh my gosh, like Swift is not so exciting. I like beginner friendly. No like it cuz here's the thing I always I always base my grounds on like, Promoting swift online. It's so, so simple to get started. So, so easy. So, so clean, so precise, you know, kind of like my whole spiel on swift and granite like, you know, swift came out. slipped is about, I don't know, six years old is still not that old. So like, that was another thing when it first came out. Because you know, Objective C was the primary language for like, over three decades for iOS development. And then swift just came out like six years ago. And so people were a little bit skeptical. It was something that was super new. And of course, there wasn't a lot of resources around it to get started. It was just new. But people who were in the iOS community, they were a little more like that. Okay, this is simple. This is something, um, you know, and yeah, so it's a little bit it's tricky because like, it's still kind of a new net language, but it has grown so much in terms of like, resources and like getting started and like it's so I promise you is so much easier to get started. Now with swift and like swift has grown actually, in so many different ways. You don't even have to build for iOS development with swift primarily anymore, like swift has grown in so many ways. Like, you can use swift on the server. Now I'm sure you've seen some things about server side Swift. You might have seen some things and like, big companies are adopting it. You know, there's AWS and, you know, just there's so so many different platforms like really starting to add on some, you know, support for Swift. So, yeah, you can use swift on the back end. You can you know, Swift is also an open source language now, so That opened up a whole a whole kind of thing where now the community is able to contribute and like build this language together. So that was a huge huge deal. But yeah, so like just getting started with iOS development primary language you want to learn swift you want to uh you know, of course Xcode is the primary ID. Now again, swift has grown in support. So now you can use it with you can use it with sublime you can use with all these different like, all these different IDs now. So it's not just limited to Xcode, which is different for people in the iOS community. We're all we always used to like, oh, building for iOS, you have to use Xcode. So yeah, it's a bit refreshing, but I would recommend to Starting with Xcode, because you have all the native components when it comes to building for an iOS experience, a true native iOS experience. So definitely using Xcode to build. Also being a part of Apple's developer program, okay, which is about I believe it's $100 a year $99 a year to be a part of and just, you know, have that membership. What that does is that gives you a developer profile to publish to be, you know, to publish your app into the App Store. And so yeah, so you you kind of have that $99 a year membership, and that allows you to properly test out via Expo test out your Applications and also publish the via the in the App Store. So you want to do that. And Bill just building out you want to learn as much as possible. There's a YouTube, there's, I'm gonna shout out myself. I've done a lot of like iOS content, you know, and even just my old content as well.

And you know, I'm available on Twitter as well. You can always ask me any kind of like iOS questions, or just mobile questions. But just getting started. There's like Apple does a great job of documentation as well and providing a platform for onboarding and it's such a huge, huge community to be a part of. There's so many different resources just to get started and build something super simple and super cool. Especially using swift and it's really in Swift is also really good. Like if you're coming from a JavaScript background, it's there's a lot of familiarity in the syntax. So that that's probably the best the best thing and it's grown so much. Like I said, since like six years ago, when it first came out, it's gotten a lot simpler, a lot more performative. Just a lot, just faster, and the syntax has gotten a lot smoother. And, you know, Swift is really a language that is really built on just legibility, and just being concise and precise. And, yeah, so that, you know, that's, that's kind of a jumpstart kit for getting into iOS development. That's awesome.

**Ali**  35:49  
I think you touched on this, but how do you actually get your app accepted and published onto the app store?

**Timirah James**  35:57  
Oh, that is a great question. That's a great question, because Sometimes like you if you scared to get your your your your foot through the door, and you're just like, trying to get past you know, you're past the hello world, but you're you're really just in Project land and you you don't want to limit yourself in terms of not actually publishing something that's what really pushed me through the door and getting my my first iOS engineering role. Being a college dropout, I did not have the opportunity to have an internship or be eligible for an internship. I didn't have any prior experience, I really had to go on whatever I had done on GitHub, and I said, What can I do to stand out and I wanted to publish something into the app store and that was kind of the kind of beat me up just being, you know, having something that was published. And users were actually Using So, alright, so step one, before anything where you get too happy and you're like yes, yes, yes, I want to publish the things I want to do all the things. Well, I would definitely strongly encourage you to make sure that your app complies with the apple design guidelines. Okay, so you want to review the apple design guidelines, you can Google it and go on Apple's website and you can look up the apple design guidelines. And really, they want to know, you know, they're going to do a review process, which I've heard my first application. I got super, super blessed because it was, you know, I think it took like five days at the time. I think the average time took about eight days, but I've heard horror stories of three weeks a month and I've heard like horror stories of Not only just the waiting time but also having the app go through several different rounds of review, just because, again, there was something was super buggy. It didn't just, it just didn't comply with the design guidelines. So I made sure I did my research. Okay. So, before you submit, you want to make sure that you test your app for crashes, and bugs, right? You want to ensure that you know all the app information and metadata is complete and accurate. You want to make sure that you know you enable on like your back end using a third party, you enable, you know your backup services. So it just basically make sure it's in its full form. Okay, so that the reviewers can properly kind of go through the process, whatever the user is going to do. They need to be able to like go through the whole flow. Okay. Again, complying with those design guidelines and making sure that you're using assets that are legal to use also, they look that up as well.

I, myself I used to use.

And you can always create your own right, you can use like sketch or figma, or whatever platforms you use to like create your own assets in a mobile app, but you can like, there's different websites that you can use that you can have, they allow you to add them into your application that are free. They're royalty free, that are free for creative use. And yeah, you want to make sure all of that is kind of like, cool, and they want to make sure there's no like, I mean, I don't want to say plagiarism, but more so like, you're not stealing assets, basically. Yeah, so basically, keeping up with those design guidelines, making sure it's nice and bug free, for the most part. The average time, like I said, you submit it. And average time for review is like, five to seven days. And voila, your app should be live and running and in users hands in no time. That's awesome.

**Unknown Speaker**  40:20  
That's really great. That's very useful to you. Because I would never have thought to go look at the design guidelines before just like I would totally just blind submit it and have no idea but i'm, i'm curious just to kind of like wrap things up. If someone listening is interested in getting into mobile Dev, or they're about to have their first interview. What can they expect out of a mobile development? technical interview? Oh,

**Timirah James**  40:42  
yes. So let me speak to it, especially like the iOS interview process. And this is different. So for example, I've interviewed with Apple before. So this is like, I would say, fairly recent. So I believe is still quite an actually it is more in quite the same. I spoken with a few peers of mine and the interview process is pretty much kind of the same flow. It's one of the better interview processes also. Basically, after applying, you have an initial call, just kind of seeing where your interests are, where you're, you know, where your skills lie, and then it's elevated to elevate it to someone else. Someone who is a little more technical and it's still not a technical like, like debriefing where they're just like really, really going going in on you. It's again, just to see where your skill set is. They're not giving you any like trick questions or anything. They're just really trying to see where you are and then they say, Okay, well, we're going to send you a coding project. And they give you a timeline. They say don't spend more than however many hours on it usually maximum four and say, Hey, don't spend any more than four hours, it really shouldn't, you know, expect you to spend more than that, but eat but they still give you. They don't do like the time tests or any like specialized tests like that is really more so like the coding project is like build an app that uses this framework, this framework that does this. And this is like a real world type app. So let's say, okay, build an app that uses the iTunes API. And, you know, it has images, you know, so we want the images to be, you know, cached, we want this we want that we want to be able to categorize the the cash To log in the iTunes API. And, yeah, so you basically go through all of this, you build the application, they give you a couple of days to submit, you submitted, they do a review. And the they have someone from a callback. And the callback again is not to grill you is just to go through whatever the process is what you know, what what did you do to accomplish this? and any other questions that they have about your code the project in general challenges you've had x y&z so then it kind of move forward from there. I think there's a panel interview as well. And then you know, hopefully, hopefully, a positive decision is reached after that. And offer you know, so that's more song like just For apple in itself, I do feel like that's more of the it's probably the better side of the iOS interview process, but it differs so much. interviewing for startups can vary like it varies from company to company. So like for startups, you typically get someone you know you go through the phone call or whatever and then you do you get on the phone with someone and you have some form of a technical screen where they're throwing questions at you that have to do with the swift language. So the question you on syntactic questioning you on frameworks they give you scenarios. The question the question you on terminology, you know, what is an optional describe to me what happens in threading, you know, multi threading described to me that process described to me, you know, X, Y, and Z And you kind of just go on from there just they're kind of quizzing you. And then from there on, it can be some form of a coding.

Like, you know, it can be

more of an on screen technical. Uh, yeah, like an on like a an on screen like technical screen. So basically you having whatever their browser based IP is, um, and kind of coding like pair programming or they watch you kind of solve a problem using Swift. So yeah, it can vary from there. And if you're going for other than, you know, besides Apple be going for a top tier companies such as, and this is where it kind of deviates, you going from a top tier, you go into a top tier companies such as like Facebook, I've had so I've had a trick interview process with Facebook, actually. So I had it, we had the initial call, and I thought the initial call was just going to be, you know, just like every additional call, we're just going over like skills and, you know, compatibility in terms of like the roll and things of that nature experience. But then at the end, they just threw in the technical questions. I was like, Oh, okay. So like, so the recruiter, threw in the technical questions, and they were mostly like, iOS swift based, um, it threw me off guard, but I passed. And then they're like, Okay, so, Next up, we're going to do, we're going to do a coding project. And then after the coding project we're going to do we're going to have the review, right? We're gonna have it you know, again, the the engineer kind of review that But also we're going to after that, we're going to kind of test you on data structures and algorithms, like, I'm kind of getting into more of the CS theory bag. So I'm like, Okay, I'm like, okay, so I have to, like, study way off, you know, I always get thrown way off whenever I have to go into that bag, because it's so long, like, think about the time span, right? You're working on something, you know, you're building, you're using these different technologies. You're doing great in this in this specified tech stack around, right. And then you know, you're doing that for I don't know, anywhere from six months to like two years at this one company. And then you say, hey, I want to move on to another company. And, you know, you have to prepare something totally different. outside of your skill set for the interview process, but they still, you know, in the role, they don't want you to use any of those skills that you just study for they want to you, they want you to, they're hiring you for the skills that you've had from your prior role. So, you know, having to go back into that college bag is always just a drag. Because there's always so long in between those times where I have to study and it's just for such a momentary situation, you

**Ali**  48:30  
know, for sure interviews are such a messy process across tech, I think. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Thank you so so much again for joining us on the show today and teaching us all about mobile development. Where can we find you on the internet?

**Timirah James**  48:49  
I you can find me all throughout the internet's the internet.

**Unknown Speaker**  48:57  
But

**Timirah James**  48:58  
yeah, mostly actually. on twitter at to marriage a ti m IRHJ. You can tweet me You can follow me. You can DM me, my DMS are always open, ask me questions, collaborate on things, so on and so forth. So yeah, follow me on Twitter. Also the same Tamara Jay on Instagram, and connect with me on LinkedIn to Mary James. And okay, yeah, I'll just put that on my website out there to Tamara James calm.

**Unknown Speaker**  49:32  
Yeah. And well, we're gonna be linking all of these in the show notes. If you want to go check out Tamara. And the best part is, she is available for hire. So if you are interested in hiring to Mira if you want her for a job, evangelist role, where's the best place people can contact you for that?

**Timirah James**  49:48  
Yeah, absolutely. Um, I believe Twitter is still the probably the best forum to get me is very immediate and very like, you don't just my dm are always open. So if you want to reach me, you can definitely get me on Twitter. And you can connect with me also on LinkedIn to marriage, James on LinkedIn, and I am looking for more of the dev REL role. So anything again to make other developers lives easier. That's like, that's my passion. That's right up my alley and building communities, and just bettering the developer ecosystem. That's really where my heart is wonderful. Thank you so much. It was like such a pleasure especially because I knew nothing about mobile Dev and it's always fun to talk to you. I'm, you know, when you get to talk as much as I wanted to and am so I'm really excited that you are willing to come on and teach us about Absolutely, I feel like as you can see, I can go on and on. You know,

**Unknown Speaker**  50:46  
I really love it. It's good. It means you're passionate.

**Unknown Speaker**  50:50  
So we like to wrap things up here by doing a shout out to either someone or something that we are thankful for or we think is really cool. We want to share with the listener. So what Or who would you like to shout out,

**Timirah James**  51:01  
I would like to shout out everyone who has contributed to the Black Lives Matter movement. I would like to shout out everyone who has and I mean that in every way whether you've protested whether you've contributed whether you've done something to amplify black voices, whether you reached out to a co worker, just check on them, you know, whether you have just raised you know, just elevated your, your your own voice and paints throughout the Black Lives Matter movement that's going on right now. It's totally appreciate it. I want to shout out people who are struggling right now, through everything that has been so traumatic for all of us, this troubling time people who are dealing with mental health issues. We're dealing with that before all of this was going on, and who are just fighting through that, and trying to just keep keep their heads above water. And people again, who are also fighting to, you know, for jobs who have lost jobs in this time and in this climate in this weird time that we're in, and who are also going through these interview processes. I really hope that what I said anything of what I said, helped you with any kind of clarity. I want to be a resource to you. Like I said, you can reach me on twitter at Tamara Jay, you can connect with me on LinkedIn as well. But I want to let all those people know that you are seeing you are heard you are appreciated. You are loved at this time. And, you know, I just want to acknowledge you right now. Oh, that's really that was

**Unknown Speaker**  52:59  
words. Thank you. You for that?

**Ali**  53:01  
Yeah, it was amazing. Yeah.

**Unknown Speaker**  53:03  
How about you ally? What would you like to shout out?

**Ali**  53:06  
I don't know how to follow that one

**Unknown Speaker**  53:07  
up.

**Ali**  53:11  
Yeah. Um, so a project that I think is really, really cool right now is the web monetization API. So there is this project to fund content creators through a subscription type model. And every time that somebody who is subscribed to this service visits your site, you make income off of that without advertising without any kind of sketchy things. And I think that it could lead to a more ethical web. So it's a movement that I'm really excited about dev to just integrated into their platform and so excited to see where it goes. Emma, how about your so

**Unknown Speaker**  53:55  
I'm reading this book called the courage to be disliked, and it's the Japanese phenomenon. Went on that shows you how to change your life and achieve real happiness. And it's very interesting because it, it feels like a nonfiction book. But I think it's based on like Greek and German philosophy. And it's a conversation between a philosopher and a student. And I've learned a lot like one of the things we've mentioned earlier was focused on yourself, compare yourself to who you were yesterday and not other people around you. And there are a lot of really great sentiments coming out of that. So if you are looking for a book to kind of change your mindset, whether that's, you know, I think in our education episode, we talked about fixed versus growth mindset. It touches on some of those principles as well. Highly recommend it. So, you know, just I just want to give one more thank you to Tamir for joining us today. And if you like this episode, just tweet about it. You know, we'd love reading your feedback. Also, feel free to connect with Tamir on Twitter and LinkedIn, we have those linked down below. And we post new podcasts every Monday so just make sure to be subscribed to be notified and leave us a review. Have a nice, fun day.
