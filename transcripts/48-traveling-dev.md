Have you ever dreamed about selling everything you owned and moving across the world to begin a new life, and this episode, we're chatting with Rachel neighbors, an American abroad on the React core team in London. We'll chat about the pros and cons of moving abroad as well as the logistics. Let's get started.

Unknown Speaker  0:20  
Welcome to the ladybug podcast. I'm Kelly. I'm Allie. And I'm Emma and we're debugging the tech industry.

AWS amplify is a suite of tools and services that enables developers to build full stack serverless and cloud based web and mobile apps using their framework or technology of choice on the front end. Using amplify, you can quickly get up and running with things like hosting authentication, managed graph qL serverless, functions API's, machine learning chat bots, and storage for files like images, videos and PDFs amplify is built especially in a way to enable traditionally front end developers like myself to be successful because they can use their existing skill sets to build real world full stack apps that in the past, were required. deep knowledge around backend DevOps and scalable infrastructure. The amplify console then allows you to use the GitHub repository to deploy a globally available CDN with ci NCD built in. To learn more, visit AWS dash amplified.github.io. Awesome. So welcome, Rachel. I'm super excited to chat with you again. I know this has been a long time coming we've talked about during this episode. Hey, I'm

**Rachel Nabors**  1:21  
so glad to be here. I'm glad you could finally do this.

**Emma**  1:25  
Awesome. Do we also have Allie on the line today and welcome, Allie. Hey, why don't we just get started chatting about our experiences moving abroad? I'm gonna let Rachel go first and Sue our esteemed guests. So Rachel, why don't you tell us a little more about your experience living abroad?

**Rachel Nabors**  1:41  
Oh, wow. So interesting thing. A couple years back, I was I was just coming down off a stint at Microsoft and had an opportunity to work on design systems in Amsterdam. So I having traveled and spoken around the world for like six years. I knew Amsterdam was one of my favorite Cities had high concentration of awesome people I loved and I really enjoyed the food and culture there. So it seemed like a great next step. I did that for here had a bunch of life changes hit that made me think maybe I want to roll the dice and try again. So I joined the React core team and started working on site in London. Yet another big European city, very different from Amsterdam. And that's why I'm calling in from today.

**Emma**  2:26  
That's so exciting. I love London. But I remember when we chatted at a conference, you saying that you didn't like London as much as Amsterdam? How do you do still feel that way? I'm curious, like, why like, what about London do not like as much

**Rachel Nabors**  2:41  
I think there's like two or three finds of people, people who love New York City, people who love London and people who love Amsterdam. Amsterdam has a little small town feel to it comparatively. Like it's not as big and sprawling as London, but it's still got just as many people from all over the world. It's a little smaller, a little cutesy here. A little bit more affordable. And additionally, it's just so much easier to get to anywhere else in the world. If you live in Amsterdam or in the outskirts of Amsterdam, it's like a 30 minute high light light rail trip to an international airport or is in London, you kind of like on the tube in a bus. Okay, now your haul, it's like it takes forever to get to the big airports. So it really feels like you're in the Sprawl. And New York City has a completely different vibe all its own because it's very American has this Dutch roots. So I feel like you have a very kind of a Dutch mentality in New York. If you like that New Yorker kind of like I'm walking here kind of feel you probably get on great. But New York is also sort of like its own island. Whereas when you're in London, you can hop over the channel to get to all of Europe, or easily just head back over the Atlantic to visit the big cities in the United States. When you're in New York, you're kind of limited to New York and Philadelphia, because the United States isn't as well connected to itself or the rest of the world as he would get over here in Europe. So these are very similar cities in many ways. But they're also very different from each other. So different vibes. Yeah,

**Emma**  4:15  
I yeah, that totally makes a lot of sense because I, well, let me just quickly relay my experience living abroad. So I studied abroad when I was a junior in college, and I studied in London for three months. I loved it. I love the rain, although it didn't rain when I was there. And then, so I was kind of knew I wanted to move abroad and then I lived in Germany after my first real job, I sold everything and I moved to Germany. I lived there about two and a half years I was in Karlsruhe, which is an hour from Frankfurt, so it took like an hour, an hour and a half train to get to a major airport to fly anywhere. And then two months ago, I moved to Stockholm in Sweden. So I've really been enjoying that and what a little later in the episode we'll delve into kind of the details, pros and cons of each of these places to live. But yeah, so Ali Do you have experience living around I do not have

**Ali**  5:04  
experience living abroad. That being said I have been mostly location independent for the last almost year and a half I think so what that means is that I have not for the most part had apartment I have been mostly living out of Airbnb ease and with friends. And so I've been working remote and that has allowed me to have a lot of flexibility of not necessarily living in one place. I feel like for a while last year, I was living at conferences because I had so many speaking gigs lined up that I was like it hotels every week for those and so I didn't have an apartment I would just crash with my parents if I didn't have a conference at that that time and then after that, once conferences and one down, I lived at our Airbnb ease and you get a huge discount if you live there for a month at a time. And so I would just do that and live at a different cities for a while, and then I technically moved to New York City at the beginning of the pandemic. But it was a little bit hard to not know anybody and be locked in an apartment for a couple of months. So after that, I ended up moving in with my boyfriend Chicago. So, um, yeah, I don't even know where I legally live now. But it's kind of cool. And I think I would go back to living at Airbnb is if my boyfriend was location or if he didn't have like a in person job. So

**Emma**  6:44  
well, that's cool that we all kind of have similar yet different experiences. And this kind of ties into the next section where I want to discuss what an immigrant versus an expat versus a digital nomad are. What that wasn't a real sentence, but you know what I mean? So let's talk a little bit about these three terms. I'm going to let Rachel describe the difference between immigrant and xy because I think that you did a fantastic job before we started recording. So Rachel, can you explain the difference between an immigrant and x pack for us, please,

**Rachel Nabors**  7:10  
sir, happy to. So I actually wasn't even aware that there but there was like a distinction between these terms before I moved to Amsterdam, where I worked at booking and they hire from all over the world. So I was working with people from Brazil, I was working with people from like, Borneo, just all kinds of places. And this came up in conversation one or two times that, you know, like many places in the world, there are people from around the world moving to the Netherlands. And some of those people are referred to by the locals as immigrants and some are called expats. And if you are a high earner, preferably from a first world country, you may decide to move back to you are an expat. You have a home it's just not here. You're a welcome visitor in the country. Maybe if you earn enough you'll even be welcomed as a native one day. But if you are, for instance a refugee or here's like someone from a further Eastern country or a undesirable location, typically seen as a lower earner, you're probably going to get slapped with the label immigrant, which is kind of a dirty word. The definition of immigrant is a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country. And you could say that I was looking to move to another country myself. Back when I moved to Amsterdam, it was definitely something I wanted to do. Although now I'm a bit more ambivalent on that because I've kind of seen that all countries have their their downsides and their skeletons in the closet. Amsterdam be you know, the Netherlands has a number of its own for as much as I love the place. But in general, all of the things that are marketed to me like as American abroad there, it's like x pack magazine x pack. text, you know, expert, expert expert. Even if I were to, you know, hand in my American passport and say I am officially a member of this country now, I probably still be referred to as an expert.

**Emma**  9:13  
Yeah, that's really interesting the connotation and I, to be honest, it was very naive when I was posting on Twitter about how as an expat and I, you know, there were some comments and the threads talking about the difference between an expat and an immigrant from like a connotation standpoint, and I think you summed it up pretty well. So even though, like the definitions are generally the same, except for the fact that an immigrant is typically permanent, yeah, there are definitely some negative connotations associated with the word immigrant in lieu of XPath. So, yeah, I don't know how I feel about that personally. And I don't Yeah, I don't feel educated enough to have that discussion today. But I thought it was important that we clarified that before we moved forward. But Ali, do you want to quickly talk about what a digital nomad is because this is also something that people listening might be really interested in, especially during the time of work. A lot of us are working remotely.

**Ali**  10:10  
Yeah, for sure. So, digital nomads are essentially people who work remote or aren't tied to a physical location for work. And so they live in a quote unquote, nomadic manner, which means that you just move a lot, I guess, or don't have a permanent address, or legally, you'd normally use like your parents address or a friend's address or something like that. So you can get your mail mailed to you. But other than that, you kind of live in different places at different times. So I think it's awesome because I get to experience a lot of different areas, I have to stay in the United States because of my dog, she would have to get in quarantine to go into most different countries. And I don't want to deal with that. So there's so much to see just in the United States and so many different cultures in different cities. And so I don't feel like I'm lacking Mostly staying in the United States. But that's a little bit of what a digital nomad is.

**Emma**  11:04  
Yeah, definitely. And we'll get more into the pros and cons. Next. cons, you know, one of that being relocating with pets if that or children. But let's quickly let's talk about the pros, because I think this is what most people think of when they think about moving abroad. So Rachel, you wanna start us off with one of the pros for you personally moving abroad?

**Rachel Nabors**  11:25  
Well, so for me,

I had a lot of different reasons why I wanted to move abroad. Part of it is health care in most most wealthy countries in the world, your healthcare is taken care of by the state. Maybe if you have a big fancy employer like I do, you get some private health care thrown in there. Which means you know, like, you get to go to the fancy clinic day of appointment instead of having to schedule it a couple weeks out. But for the most part, it was really amazing. Both in Well, I mean, I like the Amsterdam system a little bit better. In London, the NHS has been sometimes a bit of a letdown. It's, it's slow, but in Amsterdam, you know, like, you need to see a doctor, boom, you're seeing the doctor, boom, you're going home, you never take your wallet out. It's kind of amazing. And so if it's like for me, I, I was raised poor. And I started my career late and under employed because of the recession for like, a decade. And I'm looking at, like, where I was raised. We had a lot of retirees, I see what happens when people run out of money in the United States, and they're retired and I'm like, man, do I want to grow old in this country? Maybe it's time for me to look at countries that take care of their citizens. And the outlook for as you get older in these countries is completely different. Like you get to be so much more chill. You get to really just focus on doing your best with your young years without freaking out about what happens if I get cancer. What happens if my kids get cancer? Oh my god, am I going to be like a six year old person to get cancer and not have millions of dollars stashed to pay For all the treatments, I'm not going to be able to afford, like people used to die in my community for a lack of health care, and I don't want to go out like that. So healthcare is not a bad reason to be looking abroad. It's not in your immediate present. Then think about as you get older in life, where is it that you want to be seeking help?

**Emma**  13:19  
Yeah, for sure. And I want to add to this too, because when I was living in the States, my first job out of college, I was working at IBM, I had an HSA like a health savings account. And so generally what you do is, I don't think there was a premium necessarily, so I wouldn't pay per month, but every month I would put money into this health savings account, and I would use it for health related expenses. My employer would also match it well, I got sick like my second month out of like joining IBM, and I got kidney stones really badly on a cruise ship in Mexico and I needed two surgeries. I was at the hospital like three or four times I needed to do surgeries. And unfortunately, they were out of network and I accrued 10s of thousands of dollars in debt and then As someone who was privileged to have a great health care plan and with a great employer, and I was in debt for many, many years, I moved to Germany and a few months after I moved there, I needed surgery. I had an ovarian cyst, and I needed to get it removed. And I was in the hospital for four days. And it cost me 40 euro, which is about, like 30 bucks. Yeah. So, yes, healthcare is massive. Although I'm Sweden, and in Germany, I think because the health care so good, the taxes are much higher. So I think 3030 to 40% of my income goes to taxes, but education is free. We'll talk more about that later. Education is free. Healthcare is very, very affordable. So huge incentive.

**Rachel Nabors**  14:41  
Actually, this reminds me like you're in Stockholm. By the way, Stockholm is a place I would love to live. I am so fond of the Scandinavian and Nordic countries, because mostly I love saunas, but also because I'm just I'm a cold weather person and I like not standing close to other people. And I feel like that is a cultural thing. But in Sweden, the the support around childcare and like like I believe it's subsidized daycare for your kiddos as a woman, Sweden is one of the best place to go far in your career as a woman. There's like paternity leave equal to women's maternity leave that just if I were going to have kids, man, I would be right where we're where you are right now. Do you want to talk a little bit about what healthcare for kiddos and women looks like in other places?

**Emma**  15:33  
Yeah, absolutely. This is so important. Actually. Just two days ago, I got a new manager and she came back from parental leave. So it was really cool to see that it did not impact her career at all, because there is a stigma that if women go on maternity leave, it will impact their career. I think it's more so in the US and in Sweden. It turns out they get for parents get 480 days of parental leave. And I believe that can be split between two different parents. So like Her husband is also an engineering manager at Spotify. And so they've split it. But not only that, there's a monthly stipend. So you actually get paid every month and that goes towards your kids. Not only that, I think at the hospital they actually send you so I think it's traditional in Sweden after a woman has a child or the parents get to spend a night in a hotel. And like actually, like they get taken care of. And when you leave, supposedly, you get a basket full of things for your child's first year like diapers, clothing, things of that nature. Yeah, it is incredible.

**Rachel Nabors**  16:30  
Oh my gosh, and and compare that to what I saw growing up in the United States. Like I didn't want to have kids, the United States. I'm still like, Yeah, I don't think so. gun violence in schools, not for me, but it's just so different in some of these other countries. That said, I should say that this is not like every country but the United States is great on this. In the Netherlands, for instance, it looks good on paper, but When you actually see in action, women are often shortchanged by the system. Yeah, there seems to be more support from maternity leave, etc. But in practice, it's not as great as you would think it could be compared to someplace like Sweden. So you really, if you're thinking about, maybe I should have some children abroad, you've probably talked to some parents in those countries to see what it's like for them, especially expat parents, because sometimes experts don't get those benefits. So you might want to talk with some people who have had their children abroad, and see what that's been like for them.

**Emma**  17:34  
That's a really good point. I didn't even think about that. Let's talk quickly about learning a language. This is a big question I get all the time, especially when I lived in Germany, Sweden, not so much. In Germany, people were like, how do you do you need to know German to survive? And so the question is, do you need to know the local language to succeed or to live essentially and the answer is, it depends. So, in Germany, I worked for an English speaking company. And this is a really good tip if you're an American looking to move abroad to a foreign country, maybe look for American companies that have offices abroad because generally their offices will speak English and that's what I did. Which was really cool also, because I got to travel back to the states for work trips, and I also see my family because traveling back is very expensive. But learning a language is really great. And both Spotify as well as LogMeIn, when I was there paid for language classes, so I don't I didn't need to know German for the workplace. I didn't need I don't need to know Sweden. I don't need to know Sweden. I don't need to know Swedish to work at Spotify. I also don't really need Swedish to live in Sweden. Everyone speaks very good English. But my recommendation is always like, if you're going to live abroad, get the most out of it and learn the local language.

**Rachel Nabors**  18:49  
Oh, my opinion on that. Like when I moved to Amsterdam, even though in the office everyone spoke English because it was an international crew English was the chosen language. franker, it's easier to find people from Brazil who speak English than people from Brazil who speak Dutch. And Dutch is, let's be honest, it's the ugly baby German and English would have. But it's, it's, I have misophonia and sometimes listening to teenage girls gossiping on the public transportation was just too much. I was like, Oh, no more. But it was a lot of fun. I love trying to learn the language. I had the textbooks there were supportive classes, etc. But I should also point out that I went through a huge life change, I got divorced, and I had to choose in the evenings, whether I was going to spend that half hour studying my Dutch or if I was going to spend it talking to my lawyer, and I ended up spending my time on the lawyer. And you know, I actually got dragged on a little bit even though all of the Netherlands speaks perfect English and perfect multiple other languages. It is a part of the the Nederlander culture that they are multilingual. And I would get dragged on a bit by local people at the store as being like, Oh, you speak English? When are you going to learn Dutch? Hmm. And one day, it was just a little much for me because, you know, sometimes people when they had a little drink, you hear the locals complained about these immigrants not learning Dutch, you know. And at one point, I actually went off on a storekeeper, I was like, Do you ever think that maybe people would learn the language if they had the bandwidth for it, but maybe they're just going through a lot. I spend all my time with a lawyer because I'm getting divorced and my dad is dead. I would love to learn your language, but I just don't have the time. And I know I made that person feel really bad, but I hope that they'll think a little bit harder before they rag on somebody for not speaking Dutch. people when they move abroad have a lot on their plate. I was getting reoriented and setting up their new network. And sometimes when you go abroad, you're gonna encounter people nagging on you because you haven't bothered to learn the language. Like you should learn it if you can, but also if you can't, I don't think you're obligated to.

**Emma**  21:17  
Yeah, I you know what, that's a really good point because I was really an avid learner for the first like, year I was there and then I went through some really hard life changes. Very similar to you, Rachel, and it fell to the backburner and I had to be okay with it. It's not something I wanted to do. I didn't want to push it off. But you have to prioritize what's truly important in your life and for me, you know, I can grab a German speaking friend if I needed one to help translate, but I just didn't have the time so it's a really good Yeah, that's a really good point. That said,

**Rachel Nabors**  21:48  
I did practice my Dutch on the people who stuffed the like in the offices, there's always going to be like someone staffing the main counter who handles deliveries and and orienting people and I got To tell you if you're looking to practice and you're really shy. Most of the times you can find somebody on staff like in the waiting room or whatever, who's happy to banter back and forth and practice your hellos, and how's the weather's. And it can be a really fun way to get to know some people who aren't, you know, you're super intimidating colleagues or you know your landlord. So it can be fun to look for those opportunities in the office to practice your language in a really low stakes environment.

**Emma**  22:31  
Yeah, and really quickly before we keep going on some of these pros and I want to get to pros to the alley can contribute to there are definitely some that are not just moving abroad centric, but just a couple of tools. If you're looking to learn a new language, my favorite that works the best for me was lingotto. They have pretty good options. It is a little bit expensive. So if your employer will pay for it, that's even better. And it's often worth it to ask when goto was great because it was a native speaker and they were all zoomed. Meeting. And so it alternated between grammar reading and speaking, I think and vocab and stuff. And you would have a mix of group classes with other learners as well as a one on one. That for me was it kept me accountable because it'll work with my busy schedule, I could schedule the meetings whenever I wanted. So that was nice. I would typically do them during the lunch break. But because I had already scheduled it, I couldn't cancel or lose it. So I was accountable. I originally started learning with Rosetta Stone, which again, kind of expensive, but what I've noticed with Rosetta Stone, is it'll teach you out of date language. So I would learn things in German, and I would say them and the Germans would actually laugh at me like we don't say that it's really outdated. So be aware of Rosetta Stone in that sense. I think everyone knows about Duolingo. It's a free app, although the premium version is excellent, and I highly recommend it. Babel is another application as well. And then if you're looking to do translations, deep l.com is incredible. They don't have every language. Unfortunately, they don't have Swedish, but instead of literally translating sentences word By word, which can often not be correct, given the grammar of a new language, it'll actually translate it semantically. So that's really, really nice, highly recommend that I will link all this in the show notes as well.

**Rachel Nabors**  24:13  
I wanted to circle back we had talked a bit about like the pros of having kids abroad. I want to get into like the bonuses of having a kid grow up abroad. Oftentimes education for like, it's an American me going to the Netherlands or here in London, I have to pay a foreign persons. It costs a lot more. Let's put it that way. It's like paying out of state tuition, but more so. But if you have a child who is a citizen of that country, oftentimes the higher education abroad is as valuable and more affordable than it is in the United States. So if you are thinking man, I want a place where my kid can just grow up and go to school. forge their own paths on their own scheme without having to have like $100,000 in debt that they'll carry with them forever. You may consider looking at the different schools abroad and what your options are there for you know, your child when they grow up.

**Emma**  25:15  
Yeah, in Germany college was free like tuition was free you just had to get in even as a like a an expat, so I wasn't permanently living there. I could still have gone and got my masters if I'd wanted. The other thing too though, there's not as much of a stigma of not going to college, at least where I lived in Germany. The trade professions are often just as revered as the collegiate professions. And I love that mentality. Nice.

**Rachel Nabors**  25:42  
I think you find a bit of that in in the UK as well. But But this is not a conversation about the quirks of the UK which I don't feel you can compare to the EU will say that for a different podcast. Let's carry on.

**Emma**  25:55  
Definitely, um, let's talk about experience. different cities. I will let Allie take over for now on this start us off because you've lived in a lot of different cities.

**Ali**  26:06  
Yeah, for sure. So I personally really love it because I'm a super outdoorsy person, like I go on hikes every weekend, and I rock climb a lot. And being outside is a huge part of my life. And so I normally try to go to cities where there's a big outdoor culture like Asheville, North Carolina, or even like, it's kind of surprising that Chicago has a lot of that too, like we live on the lake or the lake is like, pretty close. And so there's a lot to do with that. That's something that's really valuable to me and something that you can experience something very different in different cities. And I'm trying to go to all the national parks, that's one of my big life goals. So I try to live in cities close to those and be able to get outdoors to those every weekend or most weekends. So I really like it. Because it allows me to see something new and like, get new food and meet new people and try new things never gets boring. So that's my favorite thing with it, though. I will say, settling down in a city is now just like, have a little bit of FOMO for traveling and comparing all the different cities.

**Emma**  27:23  
Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, it's nice that you can kind of get a feel for different places. I wouldn't say I moved around a lot, but I was able to travel a lot because travel in the EU is so much cheaper. Like in Germany, we would drive to Italy for the weekend and go to like FOMO you can take a, you know, a 20. Their flight from Frankfurt to London was 24 euro round trip direct. I mean, it's I think last year, I visited like 10 different countries, and a lot of that was for conferences. Like I'm really bad about taking vacation. That's not for conferences. But yeah, so unlike alley I didn't move to a bunch of different cities, but I did get to go Is it a

**Rachel Nabors**  28:00  
lot? I think visiting and moving around to different cities is actually really valuable. Like, I tell people that right now I'm looking for my nest where I it is I'm going to set up shop because I think through a lot, you know, I've lost family members I've restarted as a single person. And after many years of traveling the world and speaking and you know, living for months and even years in different cities in the United States, as well as the rest of the world, I now feel like I'm in a position to actually figure out where it is I want to like, make my home and there's nothing wrong with taking your time and traveling. I think it's like, inbuilt all humans to have a little bit of wanderlust at different periods of their life to find out where it is that that feels like home for them.

**Emma**  28:48  
Yeah, for sure. And I think you should just say come visit Stockholm once things calm I'd love to it is it's honestly when I visited it. It wasn't ever a city I cared to visit and I showed up and I'm like, I'm gonna live here someday. Now that I'm here, I'm like, this would Honestly, my forever home like I have no plans to move back to the States at all people ask me that, like, do you want to go back to the States? And my answer is absolutely not. I would love to visit, but I don't want to raise a family in the states and I would be heartbroken if I left Europe.

**Rachel Nabors**  29:14  
I would be less heartbroken to leave London I got to say it's a great place if you are young, and in in university, it's great. But as you get older and more people in their 30s and 40s move out of the city, it kind of becomes an interaction desert. And that has been a disappointment for me compared to places like Amsterdam, which to Holly's point about being an outdoorsy person. I adored Amsterdam because if you wanted to go be outdoors, you could just jump onto your bike and there would be dedicated bike roads into the countryside and you could just go all out for two hours and find yourself in a little seaside town eat fish and chips. And I I adored it I learned enough, enough Dutch to be able to go out with the local birding crew And learning the names of the local birds. That's another good reason for learning the local language if you want to have a social life helps. And so I loved that way of life. And I missed that. And I know there's not much like that in the United States outside maybe like Portland, where you can have a similar kind of car free, cosmopolitan lifestyle.

**Emma**  30:24  
in small towns. I haven't owned a car since like 2018, though it does that. Wait, hold on, wait, no, before it's been it's been longer than I say that out loud. I'm like, No. But I haven't owned a car in many years. And I haven't felt the need to buy one, which is really cool. But I will say to the language learning point, I loved actually not knowing the local language because I was not distracted as easily. And now I go back to the states and I pick up I like eavesdropping every conversation, I can't focus. So there are benefits to not knowing the language. But let's talk quickly about different cultures because this is a huge huge This is probably my biggest pro of moving abroad was experiencing different cultures. Rachel, what's your take on this? Like? Do you feel like you've been exposed to new cultures moving abroad? And if so, how has that impacted you?

****Rachel Nabors****  31:12  
Well, yes and no, you have to remember I was like traveling and speaking at conferences all over the place. So I was getting a lot of exposure to that and alley as a person who's like, going to many conferences, even in the United States, you're meeting people from around the world who are traveling to be at those events. But nothing can quite give you the feeling of what it's like to be a stranger in someone else's home. Like it is to be a to be an expat, or an immigrant. And I would say that actually helped me build a lot of empathy. I came from a small town community that was very like, why are you move here and you're not learning the language. And now I have actually been the person who's like, maybe I'm not learning the language. Because it's irrelevant to my life situation. And I have a very different viewpoint now from the ones that I grew up with, and from the people in my hometown community that I would not have gained if I had not gone, gone out abroad, and met other people in similar situations and learned about their life experiences. And it's also helped me realize some of the things that I value about American culture that isn't present in other cultures. For instance, in the United States, we have way more dialogue around racism and sexism than you'll find in cultures like the Netherlands where there are a lot of policies that would make it seem as though the the local culture was very advanced and had moved beyond that. But you'll find that the conversations are actually like two decades behind in some situations.

**Emma**  32:51  
Yeah, that's a really good take on it. I guess to your point, I definitely learned to empathize with people a little bit more and be more Patient and recognize that if someone is speaking a second language, they're very courageous, it takes a lot of courage, it took me a very long time to speak German. And even then, like, think about if you've ever seen someone who is not a native English speaker, give it a conference talk. It's scary to give a conference talk in general, imagine giving that in a second language, you have to, especially if you're not fluent, you have to memorize a lot of what you're going to say. Like, that takes a lot of guts.

**Rachel Nabors**  33:25  
And I gotta say, if you're working with international teams, this experience really, really makes the difference in how you communicate and coordinate with your colleagues. I think also Americans don't realize but we're a lot more homogenous than we think we are in terms of like our personalities, our openness or communication styles. And when, for instance, I have learned that if I'm working with somebody from a certain background, you know like Romania, I might be able to like ask Yes, I have an entire book on this called I think culture map, which is all about how communication styles have different variations in different areas of the world. For instance. There's low context communication and high context communication. Japanese is more high context culture. So when you speak together a lot more is understood. And American business people are often frustrated, at least back in the 1980s when communicating with Japanese business people because they feel like, yeah, we agreed to that, right. But that was not what the Japanese business people understood. They understood that, you know, we were discussing it, and there's all these kind of wires that you can get crossed. But I think working with more people working abroad, being exposed like that, things don't work in other countries the way they do in the United States, and you have to flex you can't just show up and be like, let's do things my way. You're not doing it my way. So you must be wrong. It's like no, you have to flex and adapt to other people, their backgrounds, their expectations, you have to try to understand where someone else is coming from, you really have to because this is their playing field, or you're all equals here. And I think it's a great challenge. And it's one we just don't get a lot of in the United States. It's

**Emma**  35:21  
funny that you brought up the culture map because later in the season, we've already recorded this episode, but it's all about the culture map and how different cultures communicate, collaborate, give feedback. So if you're interested in learning more about, you know how different cultures communicate, because to Rachel's point, Americans, you know, we like to think that we're a melting pot, but at the end of the day, we all have our cultural communication. Like, how we grew up, it definitely impacts how we communicate, collaborate, definitely check out that episode a little bit later in the season. But yeah, just to kind of keep this going because we do have to talk about the cons of moving abroad are quite a few What about how does international experience like on a resume. I think Rachel, you wrote this down, right?

**Rachel Nabors**  36:03  
Oh, this is actually a pro. I think this is one of the things that I considered when I was talking with my personal advisory board, which is kind of like what I do, instead of having one mentor have a bunch of mentors that I meet with just a little bit less often. When I was moving abroad, I was like, Well, you know, I won't be in the United States. It's the tech sector. That's the best place to push your career forward. But one of the great points that one of my advisors brought up was international experience is really useful on a resume whenever you might have to work with people from international backgrounds, which guess what in tech happens quite a bit. And being able to point on your resume and say, yeah, you know, I am totally qualified to be manager of this team of people from around the world because I worked in two different cities, in different countries and I already work with people from different cultures and look at how good I am at flexing my communication skills.

**Emma**  37:00  
Yes, definitely. It's definitely something good to have on your resume. Yeah, we talked a lot about there's so many pros to moving abroad. And I only think we've touched the surface at this point. But I don't think people think about the cons of moving abroad when they consider it. It just seems very much like a romantic idea. And it is and I don't want to downplay that, but there are definitely cons. Allie, I'm gonna ask you like, what do you have any cons of being a digital nomad?

**Ali**  37:25  
Yeah, I mean, I think the big one is loneliness to some extent, because you're not in one place long enough to really make friends there. Or at least I haven't been. So it's one of those things where you'll meet people and you'll talk to people but you don't necessarily have like long lasting friendships. And so there's definitely a loneliness to that. I think that that's the biggest one in just the sense of you're always moving so there's no real, like nesting or permits anywhere that you live. Um, so I think that those are the two big two But

**Emma**  38:01  
yeah, I've been nesting hard. I don't think I can be digital nomad like I nest hard. And I have my cats and like all that

**Rachel Nabors**  38:06  
stuff. Rachel, what about you? Do you have any cons of moving abroad? A lot actually, as a person who likes moving like being abroad? I know a lot of my friends these days are like, yeah, we're thinking about moving abroad. I feel like every four years I hear this from my friend. Yeah, United States is really tough for thinking about moving abroad. And I'm always like, are you sure about that? So one of the major reasons why moving abroad might not be a great idea is politics. When you are a visitor in another person's home, you don't get a say in how that home is run what wallpaper they put up your visitor and I will give you an example of this. So usually as Americans, we're kind of used to like I vote I have a say, everybody Listen to me, right? Well, I've been sent back at the at the UK Border. London Heathrow for various visa issues that there's no visa for speaking in the UK. Let's put it that way. There's a reason why most speakers lie and say they're there on a vacation when they come to the UK, because it's a really tricky area. And I can't like I live here now. But I don't get to votes. I don't get to have impact. I can write to MPs that they know I can't vote. So my voice means nothing. And I can still go back and vote in the United States with mailing ballots, but I have less impact here. I can't run for office can't support people who run for office. My name might not mean anything on a petition. There's all kinds of reasons in what ways in which I just don't get to say now. And nowhere was this more apparent than in the Netherlands. There's this thing called the 30% ruling, which means as a highly paid valuable worker from another nation, you don't pay tax on your first 30% of income. This helps offset There's gigantic taxes we've mentioned for having all these luxuries that you get when you enter into a country like some of the ones in the EU. And this was very attractive. Originally, this ruling would last for your first eight years in the country. And a lot of people, including some American colleagues of mine had moved to the Netherlands had children but houses set their mortgages up anticipating they would have this tax free 30% income is like an additional 1015 grand a year. And they set up their mortgages and everything like this, then guess what year I got there? Well, the Netherlands feeling a little shaky on this globalization saying a lot of new immigrants coming in. locals are starting to feel like we've given too many handouts. So a bunch of politicians ran this thing where it's like, let's reduce the 30% ruling to five years and let's do it retroactively. And people voted and it got passed. I think there were some amelioration built in but it really Scared the bejesus out of my colleagues who had set their watches by this promise that the government had made them. And then the government turned around and did a take backseat. I mean, my friends had no say in that. They just they, you know, went all in on the Dutch dream. And then it got turned around on them and had financial repercussions. So this is an example of you might feel safe because you've been safe, your whole life, everything you've always had to say they've always been able to appeal. But when you are abroad, even landlords will start dwell many times, treat you differently from the locals because they know you don't speak the language. You're not going to read the contract, they can take you for a ride. So there are reasons why being a being abroad means you have less impact, let's say. And you end up following more than leading you don't get to cause as much change as you might like to see or used to having.

**Emma**  41:58  
Yeah, I that's not something I Thought about To be honest, but it scares the heck out of me. Yeah, and I think for me to the prospect of ever getting let go from a job well, first of all, I don't know, in Europe, but at least in Germany and Sweden, I've had six month probationary periods where after six months, your progress has been evaluated, and either the employer or the employee can walk away, no harm, no foul in the States, you get hired, you can also get fired really quickly. So there's more job security in Europe. That being said, if I were to get fired from my job in Europe, granted, they'd have to have a good reason. But that would mean my visa is gone. And I would have to leave the country. So like, that's definitely a big one as well. Yeah. And in periods where

**Rachel Nabors**  42:42  
everyone's kind of like, Oh, I don't know what the economics are gonna do. My visa if I don't find a new job in the UK in two months, I have to leave or team shows up and deport me. I have to take my entire household and move it back to the United States. That's a huge expense. So I have like a two month's turnaround Fund, which is the cost of taking my life and shipping it back to the US and two months living expenses, just in case that happens.

**Emma**  43:09  
Yeah, that's super smart. Let's talk about lgbtqa issues. Rachel, I'm gonna let you tackle this.

**Rachel Nabors**  43:16  
Well, this is another thing I know a number of these friends are like, so yeah, I'm thinking about leaving the US every four years. They they're all these lovely countries that will offer you some great tax breaks, etc, you know, very attractive to some wealthy Americans. But you also have to think, like, what's this country scorecard when it comes to? Well, like, is your gay best friend going to be able to come visit you or is it illegal for them to exist? Russia is a place where this is a major problem. You might be attracted to some of the lower prices in some cultures and countries. But if you you should really do your research on what is okay and what isn't there because there are places in the world where it could be illegal for some of your family members to come see you, they could be put at risk. And things happen while you live abroad. Both my parents died while I was abroad, and that life changes will happen to you as you are traveling and living. So you have to ask yourself, you know, like, maybe you're not thinking, Oh, well, you know, that couldn't happen to me that that that situation is highly unlikely. But you'd be surprised when you're going to be like, Oh, this is a really dangerous situation here. I can't take care of this relative because they can't get to me or I can't have them come to me to take care of me. And definitely, I mean, this is more like a warning to you know, sis het people who aren't thinking about these things, because I'm pretty sure that the lgbtqa community is familiar with the drawbacks of international travel. I just wanted to remind folks who maybe this hadn't occurred to them, that sometimes Your choice of location really limits your social circles.

**Emma**  45:03  
Definitely, just for our listeners who may be unfamiliar with what a syst person is, can you just quickly define that?

**Rachel Nabors**  45:09  
means that you oh my gosh, you're asking me to do that?

**Emma**  45:13  
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry. cisgendered. It's cisgendered heterosexual person is the long form.

**Rachel Nabors**  45:20  
Yeah, it means that you are currently How do I put this, you are identifying as the gender you were assigned at birth, and you engage in heteronormative relationships.

**Emma**  45:34  
Yeah, and this is something a lot of people might not think about when moving abroad if they do fit this mold. To be honest, it's not something I actively thought about. But the fact that this, like my situation, I was very privileged to pick up and move abroad and not have to think about these things. It's definitely not this way for all people. So just, you know, even if you are very privileged and you are cisgendered and heterosexual, like be conscientious of the fact that like that is it is in and of itself a privilege. And you need to be aware of that moving abroad because not everyone has that same same ability think along

**Ali**  46:10  
similar lines. Racism is another issue that definitely needs to be thought about when you're moving.

**Emma**  46:18  
Yeah, I think there there might be this misconception that like, Oh, well, you know, some countries in Europe aren't as racist as others. I was having a conversation with a friend the other day, and he comes from Canada, and he's a black man. And he was saying that there was, you know, people make comments that like, oh, racism doesn't exist in Germany. He wanted to tell a story of how he was singled out in the Frankfurt airport for being black. And just because you don't hear about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. And so it's really important that you keep, you know, keep your eyes open. You know, this is something that, yes, it's in the media in the United States right now, but it doesn't mean it doesn't exist in other countries. And don't ask the local white people if racism exists in there. cold country asked a person of color because I remember literally having a conversation about this. There was a white person, and there was a person of color in the same room. And I remember like, my person was like, Oh, we don't have racism here. We're beyond all that. And I look over at my friend, and they kind of give me this look like, huh? And I'm like, Are you sure?

**Rachel Nabors**  47:25  
For instance, in the Netherlands, they have this tradition called Black p, which is a cultural tradition using air quotes. You can't see I'm here, cultural tradition of basically doing blackface for Christmas. And, like, as Americans were like, Oh, that's terrible. But the communication around that isn't really like decades behind. And there are people in the Netherlands who have serious beef with this. But the conversation has not moved to the point where this tradition can be phased out yet. It's But that's not something I knew before moving to the Netherlands. That was something I learned once I, you know, got situated and had a social network. And we got to talking about the things that are capital P problematic about the Netherlands. Yeah.

**Emma**  48:13  
So definitely do your research, talk to talk to people of color, see their listen to their experiences, and then make an educated decision on whether or not you're comfortable living in a culture like that. Let's talk about money. That money is always something people are curious about. I didn't fully realize the extent of how much lower my salary would be moving abroad. And I'm happy to talk about my salary in Germany, I will not disclose my current salary, I don't know litigation around legality legations on the word legality of that, but just for a reference, when I joined IBM out of college, I was offered a starting salary I think of around $72,000 a year this was it was an offer for the Armonk or the Poughkeepsie office. So, the way it worked IBM was like if you got two offers internally Whoever had the highest offer salary wise, that's what you would get regardless of which location that you lived in. So, although I took the job in Austin, Texas, I had actually gotten offer for New York in New York as I was a higher standard of living. So it was a higher salary. When I moved to Germany, I was making 55,000 euro a year, which is about 60, a little over $60,000 a year. And B Now granted, I was moving laterally, so this was not a promotion. But overall, the compensation levels are much lower in Europe.

**Rachel Nabors**  49:33  
Yeah, this is true. One of the things I think this is important, I know we got a situation. Later on, we're going to talk about the logistics of moving abroad. But when you are looking at your different offers, you want to know if they're going to offer you any sort of assistance with your tax preparation because if you're American and you live abroad, you are taxed on your country based on your country of origin, not the country or world In, like the rest of the world, so that makes your taxes super awkward, especially if you're between earning 40,000 a year and earning a ridiculous six figure salary. The way the taxes and such work is so convoluted, it really does feel like the United States is trying to drag all of its young professionals back to the country. It's like no, either you are a waiter or a barista on a year between college and high school, or you are a wealthy yacht owner. But everyone else come back to the United States right now. And you do need some tax help to figure out exactly how all these convoluted tax treaties between these different countries work and you're going to be earning less on top of that, and you're not going to have vehicles like 401 K's to dump huge sums of money into to be there for you when you need a million dollars worth of surgery when you're retired to a suburb In the United States, for like it earlier in your 20s, this might not make such a big difference. But as he like in your your long term thinking, you've got some years where you can kind of figure out do I want to leave the country and go all in on this lifestyle living in the Bahamas or whatnot? Or do I want to, you know, like, head back to the United States and just start plowing money into my 401k and make that big, fat six figure salary that's so rare to find in countries with huge social, social supports. These I mean, I can't speak to what it's like working remotely from a Caribbean island. I know that the whole tax situation there is very different. But I can't speak to what it looks like when you live in a beautiful country like the Netherlands or Germany, you do make less taxes or complicated you don't have the same retirement vehicles available to you as you do in the United States. And you really might end up thinking if you want to do this long term. How are you going to like, Which country do you want to die in? is basically what it comes down to.

**Emma**  52:06  
Yeah, and I'm gonna turn it over to Alan in a second. But to that point, while I was earning less in Germany, the social structure like if I got sick, I didn't really have to pay much out of pocket. taxes were definitely higher in Germany itself, but I was tax exempt in the US. So luckily, I didn't have to pay on my salary in Germany. But again, to Rachel's point, it does matter which country you're in. They all have separate agreements. And also, like my living expenses were different. My rent in Germany was Max 1000 euro, and that was very expensive for the area. I didn't have a car. My food was so much lower. So like, yes, you might be making less, but the standard of living is much different generally. Allie, you have thoughts on taxes. So I'm going to turn it over

**Ali**  52:49  
to you. Yeah, for sure. So even in the United States, being a digital nomad is hard for tax purposes because you're kind of moving all over the place. And so it's like, where Do you even legally live? So I have an accountant. His name is Adam Newberg and I can we can link him in the show notes. But his whole entire specialization is working with digital nomads. And he got on this call with me when I became a digital nomad and just like explained it all to me, it made me feel so much better. And it's such a cost savings as well. Like I know you have to pay an upfront amount to have an accountant but he saved me so much money. Did you know that if you do something like a speaking gig in a city, that you can then write off some of your living expenses in that city afterwards if you are a digital nomad, because it counts as like travel expenses to that area. These are the things that

**Emma**  53:41  
I don't know you can learn. Does he do foreigners abroad too?

**Ali**  53:45  
Yeah, yeah, I

**Emma**  53:46  
believe I'm gonna hire him. Yes, I need I need help.

**Ali**  53:50  
Yeah, it's so helpful and just take so much stress off of the process, so highly recommend.

**Emma**  53:57  
Let's talk about logistics moving abroad because this was what One of the things in that section that we had noted down, but

**Rachel Nabors**  54:04  
let's talk about relocation packages. Rachel, what are your thoughts on relocation packages, you want a relocation package. I mean, I know you could probably sell all your things and go abroad, just a pack pack, you can do that. Or you could get a job with a company that has a relocation package and they send a team of people to pack up your entire apartment, put it on a boat and wait for you on the other side of the ocean. That is like the cost effective way to move abroad is to let someone else pay for and handle that for you. That is the experience I've had. And and I

**Emma**  54:46  
so I've done both. And let me quickly give you a rundown of some of the things that might be included in a relocation package, but also what it's like not to have one. So both IBM and Spotify provided a relocation package and I'm not going to give like specific details but I will tell you some of the things That might have been included. If you have a car and it needs to be shipped, they will take care of that for you. They also might take care of your moving with relocating with a partner, they might also take their car and their things. Something to ask about. They generally will pay for your travel there and back or their you're not going back, but they'll pay for your travel there. They might help you relocate your pets, they might give you I had potentially, I had two options when relocating furniture where either they would ship it for me or I could sell everything and they would give me a stipend to buy new furniture. Those are just a few of the items that they might, you know, work on with us as well as visa applications and whatnot. When I joined LogMeIn, they didn't offer me relocation assistance. To a certain extent, they offered me visa assistance, which was invaluable to me because a lot of companies were not willing to invest in that for an American looking to move to Europe. So that really was extremely bad. To me, because the visa process can be very, very difficult and not knowing when to do things is taxing. So that was really valuable. But in terms of shipping things, I didn't ship a single thing over to Germany, I hired a pet relocation assistance. They were called pet relocation. They're wonderful, I highly recommend them. And we'll link them in the show notes. So they took care of all of the shots, immunizations, records, clearing customs for my pet, that was very, very helpful. It was kind of expensive. I think it was like 3000 for shoot cats to fly to Germany. But in my experience, it's worth it because a lot of people don't know the customs or like the proper procedure, and they'll get to the airport and be sent back. Wow. I do not recommend doing that. But yeah, I sold everything when I moved to Germany and I just packed two suitcases and that was really hard for me. To be honest. I was happy to get rid of a lot of crap, but also I had to give up a lot of sentimental items. So there are pros and cons to selling things and to keeping your things but I highly recommend, if possible pushing for a relocation package.

**Rachel Nabors**  57:04  
I agree it should be considered like one of the benefits, that's helpful. And it should be mentioned that if you do the smart thing, and you join a company to get Alright, so I i think i think we talked a bit about this earlier, when you join a company, if you join in the United States, you probably going to get a higher package. And that can include things like Rs, US stocks, and the stocks, there are like a one time signing bonus, right? You get them in a big fat wad. And the package offered in the United States is almost always higher than what is going to be offered in the offices abroad. If you're cool is it it makes more sense to start at American company and then take a transfer to an international office. Usually that's a little dicey, because once you join They might not want to transfer you. But if you are internal and you get transferred, there is usually a relocation package with that. So these are things to keep in mind. If you're thinking, Man, I really want to work for that London office, but maybe I should start in the New York office and then asked to be transferred to the London office, you might want to discuss that with the hiring manager before you go in.

**Emma**  58:23  
Mm hmm. I have several colleagues who've done that at Spotify, and it's been totally fine. I think that's a really great tip. Let's talk quickly about how to actually search for international job postings because I get this question a lot. I when I was looking for jobs in Germany, I primarily use LinkedIn to find jobs to make sure your LinkedIn and your resume are up to date, and that they are concise. LinkedIn was a really great tool for me. I also recommend what was the other side I used? It was not deed because indeed is us specific, I believe. is so that's x IMG is the German version of LinkedIn. They use that. So yeah, maybe that's a good idea. If you're looking to move to a specific country, maybe look up and see if they have their own version of a LinkedIn that people use to search for jobs. But I would say LinkedIn is primarily my place to go.

**Rachel Nabors**  59:17  
I would also recommend pulling on your social network. If you've traveled and spoken abroad, you probably have a very large international network or maybe you've worked with people who come from backgrounds outside the United States. Go look like I keep a basically like a big contacts Rolodex with notes about every person I've met. They don't mean that in a creepy way. But basically, it's so I can remember like, Oh, yes, don't use loves hot cocoa. I shall send her some cocoa to thank her for her help. But you should definitely mind your personal connections. If you know people who have either worked in that area you're looking for or have come from that area. You can ask them things like so where are the local jobs happen? Do you know anybody? What is the site that people are using? You definitely like the human connection really proved to be invaluable. That's where you're going to learn things about what the local culture is like. What what the career prospects in a different area are like, for instance, London is huge. And FinTech if you don't like FinTech probably won't be happy working in long term in London. But you might need to talk to somebody local to figure that out.

**Emma**  1:00:24  
Highly agree. I think that's awesome. Yeah, that's how I got my job of Spotify was actually through Twitter. So don't undervalue your social network. I also get asked a lot. Was there any difference in the interview process? And for me personally, no, there wasn't either was between Spotify and LogMeIn? There were no differences. I also interviewed at Google and Munich. Again, it's very straightforward in terms of having a recruiter or phone call, having like a technical challenge, whether it's a take home assessment or like a coding challenge, having an on site interview, and then getting an offer potentially, so it's been the same for me. Yeah, I didn't have anything any interest Have you differences. Rachel, have you had any differences?

**Rachel Nabors**  1:01:02  
Not in the interview process? No. I mean, I always end up on a different interview process every time because I have such a varied background. And there's one thing I wanted to bring up that I didn't add to our outline before this started, talk to some women in local community. If you are a woman, you definitely want to know what's your professional network gonna look like I say this because you mentioned Munich and this totally reminded me I am unit a beautiful place to visit. Gorgeous, I love the area. I have my own Dirndl like my people drinking beers in the mountains, eating sausages. It's my life. But But you'll find that unique is very traditional, not a lot of women. In high powered positions. There are a lot of women like it's a traditional place. A lot of the women in your social network probably going to be stay at home moms, not to fault stay at home moms, but if you're like a A woman who wants mentorship from sea level women in might not find them in Munich. And the same thing could be said about Switzerland. And Switzerland, the taxes are set up such that if you get married, it makes sense for the lower earning partner to quit their job and take care of the children. Usually, that's the woman. That means when I visit Switzerland, once you get into your 30s, the professional scene of women tends to cool off a bit less events, fewer people to hang out with who get you and know what you're going through. It's just you have to keep in mind that we have complex life cycles as humans, and you want to know where you're falling on that path. And what that looks like for you.

**Emma**  1:02:39  
Absolutely, that's, I think this conversation is honestly helped me as an expat slash immigrant. With in terms of the conversations I should be having the things I need to be aware of, but hopefully it also helped a lot of the listeners as well. Let's wrap things up by talking about a couple different questions that you might want to ask. Like once you've actually receive an offer or before you're going to, or maybe even to the recruiter, here are some important questions that you should ask. The biggest one that I had when I was looking for jobs is are you going to sponsor my visa? Because I had no way to get over there unless they sponsor my visa? And a lot of them said no. So that for me was something I asked in the recruiting interview, because that's kind of a deal breaker for me. Rachel, what questions would you ask

**Rachel Nabors**  1:03:22  
a foreign employer? Do you support tax preparation for the first couple of years and by the way, get these answers in writing? I actually once had someone a recruiter promised me that Yeah, tax prep is a totally covered for your complicated three country taxes. And, and then I actually got there and they're like, whoopsies that's for internal transfers only. And I was like, wait, no, you promising they're like, do you have it in writing? And I was like, Oh my God, I hate you recruiters. You're evil. So make sure you get it in writing. Also, like, are you going to offer support for my partner for my children, some places they'll offer support for partners. But what they really mean is they offer some counseling for housewives to you know how to fit in your local community. If you have like a partner who is also in text in tech, and you might be looking for a different kind of counseling that might not be very useful for them to fit in and reorient. So you want to ask about their support programs for partners. for children's make sure it aligns with your family's needs.

**Emma**  1:04:26  
Absolutely. Alan, do you have any like parting advice for people looking to become a digital nomad?

**Ali**  1:04:32  
Ooh, that's a good question. I think I've mostly put my advice in here. I think the biggest one is the accountant that especially I have a side company, which is why it's more relevant for me. I think if I just had a normal remote job that would be less relevant, but if you have like an LLC and have side work, then it becomes really important but what else Airbnb? If you We'll stay over a month you get a huge discount. So make sure that you're usually staying over a month in a place rather than doing a week in a place or three weeks in a place would be like the worst of all worlds because it's gonna be more expensive and your own in you're there for almost that amount of time. That's pretty much all that I have.

**Rachel Nabors**  1:05:18  
I've got one last pro tip for people listening, because I know we move abroad for many different reasons. And sometimes we do it for love. A piece of advice I got very long after I'd moved was when you're moving abroad when when you're moving, ask yourself if you're moving because you want to or because you want to be with someone else. Usually couples are more successful when both partners are moving because they want to be in the same place. And it's really important to level with yourself for what reasons you're moving, both of you. So that is something that I think if I'd had that advice earlier, some things would have gone different for me differently for me And I just wanted to pass it on.

**Emma**  1:06:02  
I fully agree with that, especially as someone who did move for love. But I will also say, if you do decide to move for love, make sure that you have your own support system, like make sure that you find your own niche. You find your own job, your own social circles, because that, like if something were to happen and you are no longer together, you have your own, like your own reason to be there. doesn't mean you can't move home. But I yeah, after going. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life in terms of how I've handled relationships and situations. That says nothing about the other person. That's just me personally, I have this like view in my mind, if I'll move abroad, everything will be romantic. And you know, there will never be any issues. And I have definitely changed my view on on that. But I think having your own why to be there and not. You're just moving for a person, like have your own justification, and you'll be much happier in general and it's much healthier.

**Rachel Nabors**  1:06:57  
Yeah, I mean, it's one of the top four most stressed things you can do to a relationship moves, deaths, births, and I forget what the fourth one is. It's probably Oh, I think it's like illness. And that can be a lot, you know, and it can put a relationship in a tender place to be going through so much change together. You really need to have your own North Star and like you said, your own network so that no matter what happens, you can be flexible and resilient in that situation.

**Emma**  1:07:26  
Definitely, because I know I did this. Like if if we ever had a disagreement, I would always fall back on that I gave up everything to be here for you. And then it's so unhealthy and so wrong. So please learn from my mistakes. Yeah. In any case, that's a sad note, but let's wrap things up with shout outs. That's a little bit higher of a note to end on. So Allie, what's your shout out for this week?

**Ali**  1:07:48
